  CFA-3640",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We suggest to use the common appearance of voids with a scale of $5000 \kms$
in the galaxy distribution to estimate the power spectrum on this scale. We use
a simple model for a gravitational formation of voids and we compare the
results with the matter fluctuations as constrained by the CMBR observations of
COBE. We find that a power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^n$ with $n \approx 1.25$ is
compatible both with COBE and with gravitational growth of large voids in an
$\Omega=1$ universe. A Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum, $n=1$, normalized to
produce the observed CMBR fluctuations, does not have enough power for
gravitational growth of voids with a diameter of $5000 \kms$ in an $\Omega=1$
Universe. Such a spectrum would be compatible if (i) void diameters are smaller
($3500 \kms$), the voids are shallower or if the voids are rare (we assume that
the universe is void filled); (ii) $\Omega < 1$ i.e. the Universe is open;
(iii) galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale or if (iv) the voids do
not grow gravitationally.

examples of statistical ensembles of random shapes, sometimes coupled to

generalizing the well-known Canham-Helfrich model, and in particular
incorporate the effects of thermal fluctuations. The condition that coordinate
choice be immaterial greatly constrains the possible forms of the statistical
weights in these systems, leading to very few independent couplings and hence
physically simple models. Thermal fluctuations effectively reduce the chirality
of a membrane at long scales, leading to an anomalous scaling relation for the
radius of bilayer tubules and helices as a function of chirality. En route to
this conclusion we develop a perturbative calculation scheme, paying particular
attention to the functional measure needed to describe fluctuations
