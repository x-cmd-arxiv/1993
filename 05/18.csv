account for vacuum polarization. We then calculate the proton-proton wave
function by integrating the Schrodinger equation with vacuum polarization
included. We use improved data for proton-proton scattering and for the
deuteron wave function. We evaluate the uncertainties that are due to
experimental error and estimate those that are due to theoretical inadequacies.
We estimate the theoretical uncertainty by using six different deuteron
potentials and five different proton-proton potentials. Vacuum polarization
decreases the calculated value by $0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.1}$\%. The complete result is
$\Lambda^2=6.92\times(1\pm0.002^{+0.014}_{-0.009})$ where the first uncertainty
is due to experimental errors and the second uncertainty is due to theoretical
uncertainties. Our value of $\Lambda^2$ is 2\% smaller than the value obtained
in 1969 by Bahcall and May. The improved calculations of the rate of the $pp$
reaction described here increase slightly the predicted event rates for the

odd-frequency pairing of the kind first considered by Berezinskii. Using a toy
model for odd frequency triplet pairing in the Kondo lattice we are able to
examine key properties of this new type of paired state. To make progress
treating the strong $n_f=1$ constraint in the Kondo lattice model we use the
technical trick of a Majorana representation of the local moments, which
permits variational treatments of the model without a Gutzwiller approximation.
The simplest mean field theory involves the development of bound states between
the local moments and conduction electrons, characterized by a spinor order
parameter. We show that this state is a stable realization of odd frequency
triplet superconductivity with surfaces of gapless excitations whose spin and
charge coherence factors vanish linearly in the quasiparticle energy. A $T^3$
NMR relaxation rate coexists with a linear specific heat. We discuss possible
