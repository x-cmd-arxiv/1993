systems in a quantitatively correct way. The construction of the CA from the
reaction-diffusion equation relies on a moving average procedure to implement
diffusion, and a probabilistic table-lookup for the reactive part. The
applicability of the new CA is demonstrated using the Ginzburg-Landau equation.

1/r hopping and U on-site energy. The wavefunctions, the spectrum and the
thermodynamics are studied for this model in the strong interaction limit
$U=\infty$. In this limit, the system is a special example of $SU(N)$ Luttinger
liquids, exhibiting spin-charge separation in the full Hilbert space.
Speculations on the physical properties of the model at finite on-site energy
are also discussed.

were constructed for an arbitrary rational conformal field theory (RCFT) and an
arbitrary field in it. The Boltzmann weights of the lattice models are related
in the extreme ultra violet limit to the braiding matrices of the rational
conformal field theory. In this note we use these new lattice models to
construct a link invariant for any such pair of an RCFT and a field in it.
Using the properties of RCFT and the IRF lattice models, we prove that the
invariants so constructed always obey the Markov properties, and thus are true
link invariants. Further, all the known link invariants, such as the Jones,
HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials arise in this way, along with giving a host of
new invariants, and thus also a unified approach to link polynomials. It is
speculated that all link invariants arise from some RCFT, and thus the problem
of classifying link and knot invariants is equivalent to that of classifying
two dimensional conformal field theory.
