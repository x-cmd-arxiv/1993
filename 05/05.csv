repulsive first and second nearest-neighbor interactions V1 and V2,
respectively. The statistical mechanics and the diffraction spectrum of the
model is solved exactly and analytically with the only assumption V1 >> V2. At
temperatures T ~ V1 only a broad maximum at (1/2,0,0) is present, while for
ABS(delta - 1/2) > 1/14 at low enough T, the peak splits into two. The simple
expression for the diffraction intensity obtained for T << V1 represents in a
more compact form previous results of Khachaturyan and Morris[1],extends them
to all delta and T/V2 and leads to a good agreement with experiment. [1]

order is still complete. We suggest ways of using this theory for the analysis
of numerical simulations. We test these methods numerically through the scaling
of cumulants and moments of the magnetization in the low-temperature phase of
the two-dimensional Ising model. (LaTeX file; ps figures included as shar file)

couplings at the various thresholds. It is easier, and it avoids errors, to use
throughout the gauge couplings of the standard model, and compute at each
threshold, in the usual way, the extra contributions to the beta functions from
the extra non-decoupled fields. I also point out that the SU(16) grand
unification theory, due to the large number of scalars present in it, is not

slightly larger than the unification scale.

  Using this approach for one-dimensional cranking Hamiltonian with quadrupole-
quadrupole interaction term we have studied a few properties like energy, level
density, level density parameter($a$) and moment of inertia as a function of
temperature and spin for $^{64}Zn$ taking it as an illustrative example. We
have also investigated the effects of variation in interaction strength on the
level density and the parameter $a$ as a function of temperature. The moment of
inertia, $\cal I$ versus rotational frequency, $\omega$ plot shows a sudden
rise in the value of $\cal I$ due to rotation alignment of $0g_{9/2}$ orbitals
at $\omega\approx 1.0$ MeV for a small temperature T $\sim 0.5$ MeV. At high T
$\sim$ 2.0 MeV about 40-45$\%$ of each angular momentum is generated by
alignment of $0g_{9/2}$ orbitals with an interesting result that at $\omega\sim
1.0$ MeV and spin J $\sim$ 16 the moment of inertia has almost a constant,
temperature independent value.

dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation to model pattern formation in
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a non-Boussinesq fluid. It is shown that many
of the features observed in these experiments can be reproduced by this
generalized model that explicitly includes non-Boussinesq and mean flow
effects. The spontaneous formation of hexagons, rolls, and a rotating spiral
pattern is studied, as well as the transitions and competition among them. Mean
flow, non-Boussinesq effects, the geometric shape of the lateral wall, and
sidewall forcing are all shown to be crucial in the formation of the rotating
spirals. We also study nucleation and growth of hexagonal patterns and find
that the front velocity in this two dimensional model is consistent with the
prediction of marginal stability theory for one dimensional fronts.
