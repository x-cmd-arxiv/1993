threefolds. Miranda [Mi] describes a smooth equidimensional (flat) model for
any elliptic Weierstrass threefold; such models occur naturally in the study of
moduli spaces. In this paper we use minimal model theory to link birational
maps of log surfaces (log contractions) to equidimensional fibrations of
elliptic threefolds. As a corollary we show that an elliptic fibration of
positive Kodaira dimension has a minimal model with an equidimensional
birationally equivalent elliptic fibration satisfying certain good properties
that naturally generalize the case of elliptic fibrations of surfaces. We apply
the results to the case of Weierstrass models and give a global explanation of
Miranda's algorithm.

argue that explosions of Wolf Rayet stars can lead through diffusive particle

demonstrate that the magnetic fields implied by this argument are compatible
with the dynamo limit applied to the convective interior of the main sequence
stars which are predecessors of Wolf Rayet stars; second we show that this
implies the same strength of the magnetic fields as is suggested by the
magnetically driven wind theory. Third, we use data from radio supernovae to
check the spectrum, luminosity and time dependence which suggest that the
magnetic fields again have to be as high as suggested by the magnetically
driven wind theory. This constitutes evidence for the magnetic field strengths
required to accelerate particles to 3 10^9 GeV. Fourth, we demonstrate that
within our picture the nonthermal radio emission from OB and Wolf Rayet stars
can reproduce the proper radio spectra, time variability and radio
luminosities. Fifth, the comparison of Wolf Rayet stars and radio supernovae
suggests that electron injection into the acceleration process is a step
function of efficiency with the shock speed as the independent parameter.

three sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous
interstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot
spots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition
have been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy
range from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out
by galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium
consistent with all known constraints. Furthermore we propose that radioloud
quasars accelerate nuclei to high energies in shocks in the inner sections of
their jets, and thus initiate hadronic cascades which produce the $\gamma$-ray
emission observed with GRO. Radio observations of the Galactic center compact
source suggest that there is a jet similar to that in quasars, but very much
weaker in its emission; simple modelling suggests that the power carried by
this jet is of order similar to the accretion disk luminosity. By analogy we
speculate that also radioweak quasars have jets which carry a large proportion
of the accretion power, and which accelerate particles to high energy.

well as bosonic fields other than those in the determined coupling. Therefore,
we can, in turn, use this determined part of the supergravity theory to study
all the related vacuum-like solutions. We have determined the
dilaton--antisymmetric tensor couplings, in which each of the antisymmetric

demonstrate that intersection indices (cohomological classes) calculated for

The Kontsevich matrix model is a generating function for these indices in the
continuum case, and the matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(-
\fr 12 \L X\L X +\log (1-X)+X\bigr)}$ is the one for d.m.s. In the last case
the effects of reductions become relevant, but we use the stratification
procedure in order to express integrals over open spaces $\Mdisc$ in terms of
intersection indices which are to be calculated on compactified spaces. The
coincidence of the cohomological classes for both continuum and d.m.s. models
enables us to propose the existence of a quantum group structure on d.m.s. Then
d.m.s. are nothing but cyclic (exceptional) representations of a quantum group
related to a moduli space $\Mc$. Considering the explicit expressions for
integrals of Chern classes over $\Mc$ and $\Mcdisc$ we conjecture that each
