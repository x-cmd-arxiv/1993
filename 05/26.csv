redshift correlation functions, we evaluate volume-average correlations for
configurations that emphasize and minimize redshift distortions for four
different volume-limited samples from each of the CfA, SSRS, and IRAS redshift
catalogs. We find a characteristic distortion for the 2-point correlation,
$\xibar_2$: the slope $\gamma$ is flatter and the correlation length is larger
in redshift space than in real space; that is, redshift distortions ``move''
correlations from small to large scales. At the largest scales (up to $12
\Mpc$), the extra power in the redshift distribution is compatible with
$\Omega^{4/7}/b \approx 1$. We estimate $\Omega^{4/7}/b$ to be $0.53 \pm 0.15$,
$1.10 \pm 0.16$ and $0.84 \pm 0.45$ for the CfA, SSRS and IRAS catalogs. Higher
order correlations $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_4$ suffer similar redshift
distortions, but in such a way that, within the accuracy of our analysis, the
normalized amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are insensitive to this effect. The
hierarchical amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are constant as a function of scale
between 1--$12 \Mpc$ and have similar values in all samples and catalogues,
$S_3 \approx 2$ and $S_4 \approx 6$, despite the fact that $\xibar_2$,
$\xibar_3$, and $\xibar_4$ differ from one sample to another by large factors
(up to a factor of 4 in $\xibar_2$, 8 for $\xibar_3$, and 12 for $\xibar_4$).

from anisotropic gaseous models with the data from N-body simulations of
isolated and one-component systems, each having modest number of stars. The
statistical quality of N-body data was improved by averaging results from many
N-body runs, each with the same initial parameters but with different sequences
of random numbers used to initialize positions and velocities of the particles.
We study the development of anisotropy, the spatial evolution and energy
generation by three-body binaries and its N-dependence. We estimate the
following free parameters of anisotropic gaseous models: the time scale for
collisional anisotropy decay and the coefficient in the formulae for energy
generation by three-body binaries. To achieve a fair agreement between N-body
and gaseous models for the core in pre- as well as in post-collapse only the
energy generation by binaries had to be varied by N. We find that anisotropy
has considerable influence on the spatial structure of the cluster particularly
for the intermediate and outer regions.

the dynamical invariants have been derived from the Lagrangian density which is
considered to be a 4- vector. A la Majorana interpretation of the 6- component
""spinors"", the field operators of S=1 particles, as the left- and
right-circularly polarized radiation, leads us to the conserved quantities
which are analogous to those obtained by Lipkin and Sudbery. The scalar
Lagrangian of the Joos-Weinberg theory is shown to be equivalent to the
Lagrangian of a free massless field, introduced by Hayashi. As a consequence of
a new ""gauge"" invariance this skew-symmetric field describes physical particles
with the longitudinal components only. The interaction of the spinor field with
the Weinberg's 2(2S+1)- component massless field is considered. New
interpretation of the Weinberg field function is proposed. KEYWORDS: quantum
