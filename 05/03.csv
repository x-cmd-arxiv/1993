coupled one-dimensional chain of maps. We discuss the existence of coherent
regions in terms of the presence of defects along the chain. We find out that
temporal chaos is instantaneously localized around one single defect and that
the tangent vector jumps from one defect to another in an apparently random
way. We quantitatively measure the localization properties by defining an
entropy-like function in the space of tangent vectors.

vectors of a complex ghost pair at a finite mass scale with observable physical
consequences. It is shown that the ghost states exhibit unusual resonance
properties and correspond to a complex conjugate pair of Pauli-Villars
regulator masses in the euclidean path integral formulation of the theory. An
argument is given that microscopic acausality effects associated with the ghost
pair remain undetectable in scattering processes with realistic wave packects,

in the spontaneously broken phase of the four dimensional O(4) symmetric scalar

is determined in a Monte Carlo simulation which interpolates between the
hypercubic lattice regulator and the higher derivative regulator in continuum
space-time. The same method can be used to calculate the Higgs mass bound in
continuum space-time. In a large-N analysis, when compared with a hypercubic
lattice, we find a relative increase in the triviality bound of the higher
derivative regulator suggesting a strongly interacting Higgs sector in the TeV
region with negligible dependence on regulator parameters. When the higher
derivative regulator mass is brought close to the Higgs mass the model requires
a more elaborate analysis of complex ghost states in scattering amplitudes.

universal high-order adiabatic approximation(HOAA) method with Berry's phase

method can be regarded as a non-trivial generalization of the HOAA method for
closed quantum system presented by this author before. In a general situation,
the probabilities of adiabatic decay and non-adiabatic transitions are
explicitly obtained for the evolution of the non-Hermitian quantum system. It
is also shown that the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry's phase factor for the
non-Hermitian case just enjoys the holonomy structure of the dual linear bundle
over the parameter manifold. The non-Hermitian evolution of the generalized
forced harmonic oscillator is discussed as an illustrative examples.

the background of Witten's semiclassical black hole and in the exact 2D
dilaton-graviton background of Dijkgraaf et al. We find the exact solutions for
weak fields, leading to conclusions in disagreement with previous studies of
tachyons in the black hole. Demanding that a state in the black hole be well
behaved at the horizon implies that it must tend asymptotically to a
combination of a Seiberg and an anti-Seiberg c=1 state. For such a state to be
well behaved asymptotically, it must satisfy the condition that neither its
Seiberg nor its anti-Seiberg Liouville momentum is positive. Thus, although the
free-field BRST cohomologies of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) theory is the same
as that of a c=1 theory, the black hole spectrum is drastically truncated:
THERE ARE NO W_INFINITY STATES, AND ONLY TACHYONS WITH X-MOMENTA | P_TACH | <=
| M_TACH | ARE ALLOWED. In the Minkowski case only the static tachyon is
allowed. The black hole is stable to the back reaction of these remaining
tachyons, so they are good perturbations of the black hole, or ``hair''.
However, this leaves only 3 tachyonic hairs in the black hole and 7 in the
exact solution! Such sparse hair is clearly irrelevant to the maintenance of
coherence during black hole evaporation.
