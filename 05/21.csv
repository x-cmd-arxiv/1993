systems that can be described by cellular automata (CA). There is a well-known
injective map which identifies any CA-invariant subshift with a central formal
language. However, in the special case of a symbolic dynamics, i.e. where the
CA is just the shift map, one gets a stronger result: the identification map
can be extended to a functor between the categories of symbolic dynamics and
formal languages. This functor additionally maps topological conjugacies
between subshifts to empty-string-limited generalized sequential machines
between languages. If the periodic points form a dense set, a case which arises
in a commonly used notion of chaotic dynamics, then an even more natural map to
assign a formal language to a subshift is offered. This map extends to a
functor, too. The Chomsky hierarchy measuring the complexity of formal
languages can be transferred via either of these functors from formal languages
to symbolic dynamics and proves to be a conjugacy invariant there. In this way
it acquires a dynamical meaning. After reviewing some results of the complexity
of CA-invariant subshifts, special attention is given to a new kind of
invariant subshift: the trapped set, which originates from the theory of
chaotic scattering and for which one can study complexity transitions.
