$halo$, which should be associated with the residual of the stellar wind of a

metal particles are examined as a function of the number of constituent
fermions $A$. It is pointed out that the shell-structure-linked oscillations in
the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoneutron cross section in
nuclei, earlier recognized for $A > 63$, in fact persist down to the lightest
nuclei. Averaging over the oscillations or focusing on the lower envelope of
the oscillating curve (magic nuclei), the FWHM is seen to generally decrease
with increasing $A$, consistent with $A^{-1/3}$, a dependence which was earlier
known to hold in metal particle systems. If the FWHMs are scaled by the
respective Fermi energies and the inverse radii by the Fermi wave vectors, the
two data sets become comparable in magnitude. A schematic theoretical
description of the systematics is presented.)

long scale determined by a typical wavelength or domain size, and a short scale
pertaining to front structures separating different domains. Such patterns
naturally develop in bistable and excitable systems, but may also appear far
beyond Hopf and Turing bifurcations. The global behavior of domain patterns
strongly depends on the fronts' inner structures. In this paper we study a
symmetry breaking front bifurcation expected to occur in a wide class of
reaction-diffusion systems, and the effects it has on pattern formation and
pattern dynamics. We extend previous works on this type of front bifurcation
and clarify the relations among them. We show that the appearance of front
multiplicity beyond the bifurcation point allows the formation of persistent
patterns rather than transient ones. In a different parameter regime, we find
that the front bifurcation outlines a transition from oscillating (or
breathing) patterns to traveling ones. Near a boundary we find that fronts
beyond the bifurcation can reflect, while those below it either bind to the
boundary or disappear.

presents new transitions corresponding to structural transformations of the
jam. We discuss their relevance in the infinite size limit.
