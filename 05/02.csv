and an explicit formula describing them is presented. This result is used for
the dimensional reduction in a theory of multidimensional gravity with
curvature squared terms on $M^{4} \times S$. We calculate the potential of
scalar fields, emerging from extra components of the metric and torsion, and
analyze the role of the torsion for the stability of spontaneous
compactification.

representation) for SU(2) with fermions in 3 + 1 dimensions. The
gauge-invariant operators and hamiltonian are realized in a Hilbert space of

identities one that connects open path operators with loop operators and other
involving the end points of the paths.
