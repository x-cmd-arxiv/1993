calculating the critical temperature Tc for model Einstein-phonon- and
spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductors within both the standard,
Fermi-surface-restricted Eliashberg theory and the exact mean field theory,
which accounts for the full momentum structure of the pairing potential and the
energy dependence of the density of states. By using two models of

results are independent of the details of the dynamical susceptibility, which
is taken to be the pairing potential. We also compare these two models against
available neutron scattering data, since these data provide the most direct
constraints on the susceptibility. We conclude that the van Hove singularity
does not drastically alter Tc from its value when the density of states is

in importance to that of the energy dependence in the density of states.

derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the scalar field driving inflation, find
its stationary solutions and solve the FP equation for a delta-function initial

algebra ${\bf g}$ generalisations of Sine Gordon theory which are likewise
integrable and possess soliton solutions. The solitons are \lq\lq created"" by
exponentials of quantities $\hat F^i(z)$ which lie in the untwisted affine
Kac-Moody algebra ${\bf\hat g}$ and ad-diagonalise the principal Heisenberg
subalgebra. When ${\bf g}$ is simply-laced and highest weight irreducible
representations at level one are considered, $\hat F^i(z)$ can be expressed as
a vertex operator whose square vanishes. This nilpotency property is extended
to all highest weight representations of all affine untwisted Kac-Moody
algebras in the sense that the highest non vanishing power becomes proportional
to the level. As a consequence, the exponential series mentioned terminates and
the soliton solutions have a relatively simple algebraic expression whose
properties can be studied in a general way. This means that various physical
properties of the soliton solutions can be directly related to the algebraic
structure. For example, a classical version of Dorey's fusing rule follows from
the operator product expansion of two $\hat F$'s, at least when ${\bf g}$ is
simply laced. This adds to the list of resemblances of the solitons with
respect to the particles which are the quantum excitations of the fields.

invariant under gauge transformations. The existence of this invariant algebra
is closely related with the existence of a differential algebra $\delta _{{\cal
H}} G_{q}$ compatible with the Hopf algebra structure. It is shown that $\delta
_{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ exists only for the quantum group $U_{q}(N)$ and that the
quantum group $SU_q(N)$ as a quantum gauge group is not allowed. The
representations of the algebra $\delta _{{\cal H}} G_{q}$ are con- structed.
The operators corresponding to the differentials are realized via derivations
on the space of all irreducible *-representations of $U_q(2)$. With the help of
this construction infinitesimal gauge transformations in two-dimensional
classical space-time are described.
