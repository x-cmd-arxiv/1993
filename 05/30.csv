longitudinal gauge bosons might be relevant in probing the strongly interacting
symmetry breaking sector of the electroweak interactions, by showing the
dependence of the one loop amplititude for ($ w^{+} w^{-} \rightarrow
\overline{t} t $) on the symmetry breaking mechanism. The one loop amplitude
for ($ w^{+} w^{-} \rightarrow \overline{t} t $) is calculated for the standard
model and extended technicolour theory. Techni-rho meson exchange is also
briefly discussed.
  We find at $m_{t} = 150 ~GeV$ the cross section of top pair production in $
e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions is comparable in order of magnitude to that of the
longitudinal gauge boson scattering.

added to the standard action for the point-like spinless relativistic particle.
Since here the three-dimensional space-time is considered at the beginning, the
torsion of the world curve is defined with a sign in contrast to the previous
consideration: V. V. Nesterenko, J. Math. Phys. 32, 3315 (1991). Upon obtaining
a complete set of constraints in the phase space a generalized Hamiltonian
description of a new version of the model is constructed. This enables one to
quantize the model canonically and to derive exactly the relation between the
spin and mass of the states.
