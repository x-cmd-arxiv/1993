200~Mpc cubes (with $H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$); we also did comparison
simulations for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in a 50~Mpc box. C+HDM with linear bias
factor $b=1.5$ is consistent both with the COBE data and with the galaxy
correlations we calculate. We find the number of halos as a function of mass
and redshift in our simulations; our results for both CDM and C+HDM are well
fit by a Press-Schechter model. The number density of galaxy-mass halos is
smaller than for CDM, especially at redshift $z>2$, but the numbers of
cluster-mass halos are comparable. We also find that on galaxy scales the
neutrino velocities and flatter power spectrum in C+HDM result in galaxy
pairwise velocities that are in good agreement with the data, and about 30\%
smaller than in CDM with the same biasing factor. On scales of several tens of
Mpc, the C+HDM streaming velocities are considerably larger than CDM. Thus
C+HDM looks promising as a model of structure formation.

studied. It is found that the photoluminescence spectrum is a weighted measure
of the single particle density of states of the electron system, which for an
undisturbed electron lattice has the intricate structure of the Hofstadter
butterfly. It is shown that for the case of a localized hole, a strong
interaction of the hole with the electron lattice tends to wipe out this
structure. In such cases, a single final state is strongly favored in the
recombination process, producing a single line in the spectrum. For the case of
an itinerant hole, which could be generated in a wide quantum well system, we
find that electron-hole interactions do not significantly alter the density of
states of the Wigner crystal, opening the possibility of observing the
Hofstadter gap spectrum in the electron density of states directly. At
experimentally relevant filling fractions, these gaps are found to be extremely
small, due to exchange effects. However, it is found that the hole, which
interacts with the periodic potential of the electron crystal, has a Hofstadter
spectrum with much larger gaps. It is shown that a finite temperature
experiment would allow direct probing of this gap structure through
photoluminescence.

The objective is to find a fast and accurate scheme for solving quantum
problems which does not involve a Monte Carlo algorithm. We use an alternative
strategy based on the method of finite elements. We are able to formulate fully
consistent quantum-mechanical systems directly on a lattice in terms of
operator difference equations. One advantage of this discretized formulation of
quantum mechanics is that the ambiguities associated with operator ordering are
eliminated. Furthermore, the scheme provides an easy way in which to obtain the
energy levels of the theory numerically. A generalized version of this
discretization scheme can be applied to quantum field theory problems. The
difficulties normally associated with fermion doubling are eliminated. Also,
one can incorporate local gauge invariance in the finite-element formulation.
Results for some field theory models are summarized. In particular, we review
the calculation of the anomaly in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the

measurements is generally negligible since radiative corrections mediated by
supersymmetric particles are suppressed by a factor of order $m_Z^2/M_{\rm

supersymmetric particle masses). However, there are a few pertinent exceptions.
For example, the radiative corrections to the rare decay $b\to s\gamma$ from
charged Higgs and supersymmetric particle exchange can be of the same order as
the Standard Model contribution. Large radiative corrections also lead to
modifications of MSSM tree-level (natural) relations. The largest corrections
of this type occur in the MSSM Higgs sector and are enhanced by powers of the

transformations that is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the base manifold is
important in a variety of contexts in mathematical physics and topology. At the
formal level, an example of such a measure is given by the Chern-Simons path
integral. Certain measures of this sort also play the role of states in quantum
gravity in Ashtekar's formalism. These measures define link invariants, or more
generally multiloop invariants; as noted by Witten, the Chern-Simons path
integral gives rise to the Jones polynomial, while in quantum gravity this
observation is the basis of the loop representation due to Rovelli and Smolin.
Here we review recent work on making these ideas mathematically rigorous, and
give a rigorous construction of diffeomorphism-invariant measures on the space

We prove that every ""well bounded"" operator on such a subspace, say E, is a
""small"" perturbation of a multiple of identity, where ""smallness"" is defined
intrinsically in terms of the geometry of E. In the opposite direction, we
prove that such ""generic subspaces of l^N_infinity"" do admit ""nontrivial well

result, and proves the so called ""Pisier's dichotomy conjecture"" in the

neutron stars through the s--wave interaction of kaons with nucleons. We
include nucleon--nucleon interactions by using simple parametrizations of
realistic forces, and include electrons and muons in $\beta$--equilibrium. The
conditions under which kaon condensed cores undergo a transition to quark
matter containing strange quarks are also established. The critical density for
kaon condensation lies in the range (2.3--5.0)$~\rho_0$, where
$\rho_0=0.16$~fm$^{-3}$ is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. For too
large a value of the strangeness content of the proton, matter with a kaon
condensate is not sufficiently stiff to support the lower limit of $1.44
M_\odot$ for a neutron star. Kaon condensation dramatically increases the
proton abundance of matter and even allows positrons to exist inside the core.
We also consider the case when neutrinos are trapped in the matter. Neutrino
trapping shifts both kaon condensation and the quark matter transition to
higher densities than in the case of cold, catalyzed matter. A newly--formed
neutron star is expected to have a rather low central density, the density
rising only after mass accretion onto the star ends after a few seconds. Thus,
it is likely that if kaon condensation and/or the quark--hadron phase
transition occur, they do so only during or after the mass accretion and
neutrino trapping stages. We suggest that neutrino observations from a galactic
supernova may provide direct evidence for or against a condensate and/or a
quark--hadron transition.
