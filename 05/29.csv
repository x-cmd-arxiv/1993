in constraining cosmological models using small angular scale microwave
background anisotropies. To clarify these issues, we consider a complete
treatment of Compton scattering to second order, an approach which may be
applicable to other astrophysical situations. We find that only the ${\cal O}
(v)$ Doppler effect, and the ${\cal O} (v\delta)$ Vishniac effect are important
for recent last scattering epochs; the ${\cal O} (v^2)$ Doppler effect is not
significant on any angular scale, and other higher-order effects are completely
negligible. However the ${\cal O}(v^2)$ effect does lead to \Cy\ distortions,
which although generally below current constraints, set an unavoidable minimum
level in reionization models. We consider the small-angle approximation for the
Vishniac effect in detail, and show several improvements over previous
treatments, particularly for low $\Omega_0$. For standard cold dark matter
models, the effect of reionization is to redistribute the anisotropies to
arcminute scales; late reionization leads to partially erased primary
fluctuations and a secondary contribution of comparable magnitude. Using recent
anisotropy limits from the ATCA experiment, we set new constraints on baryonic
dark matter models. Stronger constraints are imposed (in second order) upon
models with higher Hubble constant, steeper $n$, and higher density. These
limits depend on the specific ionization history assumed, but the factor gained
by lowering the ionization fraction is generally small, and may be tested by
currently-planned

show that under certain conditions the time-dependent two-point density

Focussing on exclusion models where each lattice site can be occupied by at
most one particle we discuss as an example for such a stochastic process a
generalized Heisenberg antiferromagnet where the strength of the spin-spin
coupling is space-dependent. In discrete time one obtains for one-dimensional
systems the diagonal-to-diagonal transfer matrix of the two-dimensional
six-vertex model with space-dependent vertex weights. For a random distribution

hierarchies are constructed. The first hierarchy consists of commuting flows
and may be thought of as a straightforward extension of the ordinary and
multi-component KP hierarchies. The second one is a hierarchy of noncommuting
flows, and related to Moyal algebraic deformations of selfdual gravity. Both
hierarchies turn out to possess quasi-classical limit, replacing Moyal
algebraic structures by Poisson algebraic structures. The language of
