them in three dimensional space. From a concrete realization based on three
dimensional flux tubes bound to charges moving on the surface, we explicitly
derive all the representations of the spinning braid group. The component
structure of the wave functions arises from winding the flux tubes around the
handles. We also argue that the anyons in our construction must fulfil the
generalized spin-statistics relation.

field is revisited. Formally, it is possible to construct a de Sitter invariant
state for this case provided that the zero mode of the field is quantized
properly. Here we take the point of view that this state is physically
acceptable, in the sense that physical observables can be computed and have a
reasonable interpretation. In particular, we use this vacuum to derive a new
result: that the squared difference between the field at two points along a
geodesic observer's space-time path grows linearly with the observer's proper
time for a quantum state that does not break de Sitter invariance. Also, we use
the Hadamard formalism to compute the renormalized expectation value of the
energy momentum tensor, both in the O(4) invariant states introduced by Allen
and Follaci, and in the de Sitter invariant vacuum. We find that the vacuum
energy density in the O(4) invariant case is larger than in the de Sitter
invariant case.

identities in some detail, with several central results. First, we solve for
the correlators of the affine-Sugawara nests, which are associated to the
nested subgroups $g\supset h_1 \supset \ldots \supset h_n$. We also find an
equivalent algebraic formulation which allows us to find global solutions
across the set of all affine-Virasoro constructions. A particular global
solution is discussed which gives the correct nest correlators, exhibits
braiding for all affine-Virasoro correlators, and shows good physical behavior,
at least for four-point correlators at high level on simple $g$. In rational

broken affine modules follow the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the
