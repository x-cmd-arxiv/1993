performance of LIGO. The detection of gravitational radiation from a GRB source
not only confirms the coalescing binary model, but it will also provide
information on the geometry and energy generation mechanism of the burst.

function in integrated spectra of galactic globular cluster centers. As a
consequence, it is a priori unknown how closely line broadening measure- ments
gauge the intrinsic velocity dispersions at the cores of these stel- lar
systems. We have tackled this general problem by means of Monte Carlo
simulations. An examination of the mode and the frequency distribution of the
measured values of the simulations indicates that the low value measured for
the velocity dispersion of M30 (Zaggia etal 1992) is likely a reliable estimate
of the velocity dispersion at the center of this cluster. The same methodology
applied to the case of M15 suggests that the steep inward rise of the velocity
dispersion found by Peterson, Seitzer and Cudworth (1989) is real, although
less pronounced. Large-aperture observa- tions are less sensitive to
statistical fluctuations, but are unable to detect strong variations in the
dispersion wich occur within the aperture itself.

nonoscillating reference solution of Duffing's equation, with respect to which
the action-angle variables have to be determined. These allow the explicit
construction of the Poincar\'e map in powers of $\e^{-rT}$. To first order, we
obtain the $\varphi$--map, which survives asymptotically. To {\it second} order

B315 (1993) 17-23","10.1016/0370-2693(93)90151-7",,"nucl-th",,"  The effective kaon mass in dense baryonic matter is calculated based on PCAC,
current algebra and the Weinberg smoothness hypothesis. The off-shell behavior
of the K-N scattering amplitudes is treated consistently with PCAC, and the
effects of the subthreshold K-N resonances are also included. The effective
kaon mass is found to depend crucially on the K-N sigma term. Since the current
estimates of K-N Sigma term are very uncertain, we discuss various scenarios
treating K-N Sigma term as an input parameter; for certain values of K-N Sigma
a collective mode of a hyperon-particle-nucleon-hole state appears at high
densities, possibly leading to kaon condensation.

found. It is not reduced to the corresponding classical structure and hence it
describes the pure supersymmetric effect. For the supersymmetric Boussinesq
equation which contains the classical partner the Lax pair is given
explicitely. Thus we prove the integrability of the equation.
