five low-redshift active galactic nuclei (four luminous quasars:
PKS~0405$-$123, H1821+643, PG~0953+414, and 3C273, and one bright Seyfert 1
galaxy: Mrk~205). The HST spectra have higher signal-to-noise ratios (typically
$\sim 60$ per resolution element) and spectral resolution ($R = 1300$) than all
previously- published UV spectra used to study the emission characteristics of
active galactic nuclei. We include in the analysis ground-based optical spectra
covering \hb\ and the narrow [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 doublet. The
following new results are obtained: \lyb/\lya=0.03$-$0.12 for the four quasars,
which is the first accurate measurement of the long-predicted \lyb\ intensity
in QSOs. The cores of \lya\ and C~IV are symmetric to an accuracy of better
than
  2.5% within about 2000 km s$^{-1}$ of the line peak. This high degree of
symmetry of \lya\ argues against models in which the broad line cloud velocity
field has a significant radial component. The observed smoothness of the \lya\
and C~IV line profiles requires at least $\sim 10^4$ individual clouds if bulk
velocity is the only line-broadening mechanism. The overall similarity of the
\lya\ and C IV $\lambda$1549 profiles rules out models for the broad line
region (BLR) with a radial distribution of virialized....

  Examining published speckle measurements, together with the present result,
reveals a periodicity of 10.5 yr and allows calculation of the orbital
parameters. The orbit has a high eccentricity (e=0.82) and large inclination
(i=70 degrees), making it a favourable target for radial velocity measurements
during the next periastron (in 2000).

and the global texture models. The recent COBE discovery of anisotropies in the

present results do not allow a distinction between these models. Statistics
which distinguish between the predictions of the three theories are discussed.

description of quantum mechanics. This observation is used to determine the
thermal renormalization of critical currents, the decoupling field, the flux

degree of entanglement in dense flux liquids. The consequences of the ``polymer

large separation suvive cooling and the presence or absence of such plasma
monopoles provides a useful classification of the lattice gauge field
configurations at large $\beta$. By calculating observables in subsets of gauge
field configurations which contain or do not contain plasma monopoles it is
seen that, in compact $QED_3$, monopoles dominate the long distance physics,
e.g., the string tension, linear confining potential and dynamical mass
generation. On the other hand, the spin-spin interaction is essentially
unaffected by monopoles.

$O(4)$-invariant solution, considered on a contour in the complex time plane.
The transition is technically analogous to the one-instanton transition in the
electroweak model. It is suppressed by the factor $\exp(-2S_{0})$, where
$S_{0}$ is Lipatov instanton action. This process describes a semiclassical
transition between two coherent states with much smaller number of particles in
the initial state than in the final state. Therefore, it could be relevant to
the problem of calculation of amplitudes for multiparticle production in
$\phi^4$-type models.

quasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields. The conserved charges which
generate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on
this factorized space, each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector. The space
of fields in the anti-periodic sector can be organized using level-$1$ highest
weight representations, if one supplements the $\slh$ algebra with the usual
local integrals of motion. Using the integrals of motion, a momentum space
bosonization involving vertex operators is formulated. This leads to a new way
of computing form-factors, as vacuum expectation values in momentum space.
