  93/26","Astrophys.J. 417 (1993) 36","10.1086/173289",,"astro-ph",,"  We derive the volume-averaged 2, 3, 4, and 5-point correlation functions from
the moments of the Count probability distribution function of a redshift survey
of IRAS galaxies, and find them all to be reasonably well-described by power
laws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide evidence for
stronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on small scales.
Nevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between the correlation
functions of different order. In particular, the ``normalized"" skewness defined
by the ratio $S_3\equiv \bar{\xi_3} / \bar{\xi_2}^2$ varies at most weakly with
scale in the range $0.1 < \bar{\xi_2} < 10$. That is, $S_3$ is close to
constant ($=1.5\pm 0.5$) from weakly to strongly non-linear scales.
Furthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling
relation with density to great precision, in accord with the scale-invariance
hypothesis ($\bar{\xi_N}\propto\bar{\xi_2}^{N-1}$).

strongly chaotic systems are studied. These consist of single particles moving
without external forces on surfaces of constant negative Gaussian curvature
whose corresponding fundamental groups are supplied with an arithmetic
structure. It is shown that the arithmetic features of the considered systems
lead to exceptional properties of the corresponding spectra of lengths of
periodic orbits. The most significant one is an exponential growth of
degeneracies in these length spectra. Furthermore, the arithmetical systems are
distinguished by a structure that appears as a generalization of geometric
symmetries. These pseudosymmetries occur in the quantization of the classical
arithmetic systems as Hecke operators, which form an infinite algebra of
self-adjoint operators commuting with the Hamiltonian. The statistical
properties of quantum energies in the arithmetical have previously been
identified as exceptional. They do not fit into the general scheme of random
matrix theory. It is shown with the help of a simplified model for the spectral
form factor how the spectral statistics in arithmetic quantum chaos can be
understood by the properties of the corresponding classical length spectra. A
decisive is played by the exponentially increasing multiplicities of lengths.
The model developed for the level spacings distribution and for the number
variance is compared to the corresponding quantities obtained from quantum
energies for a specific arithmetical system.

the gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge tranformations restricted

monopole in the ordinary space. The Dirac's quantization condition then ensures
that the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the gauge theories must be quantized to have
a well-defined physical wave functional. The quantization rule for $\theta$ is
derived as $\theta=0, 2\pi/n~(n\neq 0)$ with n being the topological charge of
the magnetic monopole. Therefore, the strong CP problem is automatically solved
with the existence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\pm 1$ with $\theta=\pm
2\pi$. This is also true when the total magnetic charge of monopoles are very
large ($|n|\geq 10^92\pi$). The fact that the strong CP violation can be only
