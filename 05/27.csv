the presence in their core of a supermassive object, and the experience of one

  Our aim is to study the evolution of the orbit of a star under the influence
of interactions with an accretion disc in an AGN. The model considered consists
of a low-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole and colliding
periodically with the accretion disc. Gravitational field of the nucleus is
described by the Kerr metric. The star is assumed to move along a geodesic arc
between successive interactions with an equatorial accretion disc. We study the
gravitomagnetic (Lense-Thirring) precession of the trajectory. We do not assume
any particular value for the eccentricity or inclination of the orbit or the
angular momentum of the black hole. We also discuss the periodicity related to
the relativistic shift of the pericenter.
  The model of star-disc interactions has been suggested to explain the X-ray
variability observed in the Seyfert galaxy NGC~6814. We briefly discuss on this
subject.

of vortex filaments or ""strings"". We study the action principle and find that
it is described by the Hopf term of the nonlinear sigma model. The Poisson
bracket structure is described by the loop algebra, for example, the Virasoro
algebra or the analogue of O(3) current algebra. As a string theory, it is
quite different from the standard Nambu-Goto string in its coupling to the
extrinsic geometry. We also analyze briefly the two dimsensional case and give
some emphasis on the $w_{1+\infty}$ structure.

possessing solutions describing a number of different species of solitons when
the coupling is chosen to be imaginary. These nevertheless carry real energy
and momentum. To each species of soliton there has to correspond an antisoliton
species. There are two different ways of realising the antisoliton whose
equivalence is shown to follow from a surprising identity satisfied within the
underlying affine Kac-Moody group. This is the classical analogue of the
crossing property of analytic S-matrix theory. Since a complex parameter
related to the coordinate of the soliton is inverted, this identity implies a
sort of modular transformation property of the soliton solution. The results
simplify calculations of explicit soliton solutions.

``stagnation points'' in between, in agreement with numerous observations. This
evolution resembles the N-soliton solution of classical integrable PDE's.
