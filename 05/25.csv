guide, an experiment with sensitivity peaking at the $\ell$th multipole has to
cover $\simgt\ell$ independent patches to have a lower ``sample variance'' than

simple way of attaching an error bar to the theoretical prediction for a
particular experiment, and thereby comparing theories with experimental

subsequent Hawking evaporation of a black hole is the disappearance of

short distances (wormholes) violate global-charge conservation; if global
charges are apparently conserved at ordinary energies, it is only because
wormhole-induced global-charge-violating terms in the low-energy effective
Lagrangian are suppressed by large mass denominators. However, such suppressed
interactions can become important at the high energy densities inside a
collapsing star. We analyze this effect for a simple model of the black-hole
singularity. (Our analysis is totally independent of any detailed theory of
wormhole dynamics; in particular it does not depend on the wormhole theory of
the vanishing of the cosmological constant.) We find that in general all charge
is extinguished before the infalling matter crosses the singularity. No global
charge appears in the outgoing Hawking radiation because it has all gone down

of such an algebra in which the internal space of the Hamiltonians is described
by a tensor product of two paragrassmann variables of orders $F$ and $F-1$

three dimensions ($D$). In a recent paper with A. Chubukov and J.
Ye~\cite{self}, we have computed a universal number, $\tilde{c}$,
characterizing the size dependence of the free energy at the
conformally-invariant critical point of this theory. The result~\cite{self} for
$\tilde{c}$ can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms. Here, we use
non-trivial polylogarithm identities to show that $\tilde{c}/N = 4/5$, a
rational number; this result is curiously parallel to recent work on
dilogarithm identities in $D=2$ conformal theories. The amplitude of the
stress-stress correlator of this theory, $c$ (which is the analog of the
central charge), is determined to be $c/N=3/4$, also rational. Unitary
conformal theories in $D=2$ always have $c = \tilde{c}$; thus such a result is
clearly not valid in $D=3$.

terms to lift this restriction. The new brackets generalize a canonical bracket
considered by Lewis, Marsden, Montgomery and Ratiu for the free boundary
problem in hydrodynamics. Our definition of Poisson brackets permits to treat
boundary values of a field on equal footing with its internal values and
directly estimate the brackets between both surface and volume integrals. This
construction is applied to any local form of Poisson brackets. A prescription
for delta-function on closed domains and a definition of the {\it full}
variational derivative are proposed.

The first two branches provide new realisations of the unitary minimal series
and the other two branches give a direct product of this series with an Ising
model. We identify the integrable perturbations which move the dilute A models
away from the critical limit. Generalised order parameters are defined and
their critical exponents extracted. The associated conformal weights are found
to occur on the diagonal of the relevant Kac table. In an appropriate regime
the dilute A$_3$ model lies in the universality class of the Ising model in a
magnetic field. In this case we obtain the magnetic exponent $\delta=15$
directly, without the use of scaling relations.
