standard inflation scenario is that they are Gaussian where seeds produced by
topological defects tend to be non-Gaussian. The three point correlation
function of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CBR) provides a sensitive test of this aspect of the primordial
density field. In this paper, this function is calculated in the general
context of various allowed non-Gaussian models. It is shown that by COBE and
the forthcoming South Pole and Balloon CBR anisotropy data may be able to test
provide a crucial test of Gaussianity.

clearly between two very different ways of taking the long-chain limit: (I) $N
\to\infty$ at fixed temperature $T$, and (II) $N \to\infty$, $T \to T_\theta$
with $x \equiv N^\phi (T-T_\theta)$ fixed. I argue that the modern
two-parameter theory (continuum Edwards model) applies to case II --- not case
I --- and in fact gives exactly the crossover scaling functions for $x \ge 0$
modulo two nonuniversal scale factors. A Wilson-type renormalization group
clarifies the connection between crossover scaling functions and continuum
field theories. [Also contains a general discussion of the connection between
the Wilson and field-theoretic renormalization groups. Comments solicited.]

simple cubic lattices of up to \(128^3\) volume, concentrating on the
neighborhood of the first-order phase transition separating the ordered and
disordered phases. In both phases clusters of like spins are observed with
irregular boundaries. In the ordered phase the two different non-favored spins
are found to attract each other with a long but finite range. As a result, the
neighborhoods of the non-favored spins are interpreted as domains of the
disordered phase. This explains why the first-order phase transitions
associated with the global \(Z_3\) symmetry, including the SU(3) pure-gauge
one, are so weak.

presented. A large class of representations of the generators of the groupoid

estimating jet energies and spectra in high-background reactions such as
nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy-ion collider and the large hadron
collider. The optimal network is shown to be surprisingly close but not
identical to a linear high-pass filter. A suitably constrained deconvolution
method is shown to uncover accurately the underlying jet distribution in spite
of the broad network response. Finally, we show that possible changes of the
jet spectrum in nuclear collisions can be analyzed quantitatively, in terms of
an effective energy loss with the proposed method. {} {Dong D W and Gyulassy M
