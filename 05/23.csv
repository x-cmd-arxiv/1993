  Background Temperature Fluctuations","4 pages, report LANDAU-93-04/GR-1","JETP Lett. 57 (1993) 622-625",,,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  If the Universe has the topology of a 3-torus ($T^3$), then it follows from
recent data on large-scale temperature fluctuations $\Delta T/T$ of the cosmic
microwave background that either the minimal size of the torus is at least of
the order of the present cosmological horizon, or the large-scale $\Delta T/T$
pattern should have a symmetry plane (in case of the effective $T^1$ topology)
or a symmetry axis (in case of the effective $T^2$ topology), the latter
possibility being probably excluded by the data.

are constructed within the magnetic SU(3) sector of the 4-dimensional heterotic
string effective action. They possess non-abelian hair in addition to the
Coulomb magnetic field and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills
colored SU(3) black holes except for the extremal case. In the extremality
limit the horizon shrinks and the resulting geometry around the origin
coincides with that of an extremal abelian dilatonic black hole with magnetic
charge. Non-abelian hair exibits then typical sphaleron structure.
