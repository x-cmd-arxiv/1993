describing the phase transition of N-components helimagnets up to two loop
order in $D=2+\epsilon$ dimensions. It is shown that a stable fixed point
exists as soon as $N$ is greater than 3 (or equal). In the N=3 case, the
symmetry of the system is dynamically enlarged at the fixed point to O(4) We
show that the order parameter for Heisenberg helimagnets involves a tensor
representation of $O(4)$. We show that for large $N$ and in the neighborhood of
two dimensions this nonlinear sigma model describes the same critical theory as
the Landau-Ginzburg linear theory. We deduce that there exists a dividing line
$N_c (D)$ in the plane $(N, D)$ separating a first-order region containing the
Heisenberg point at $D=4$ and a second-order region containing the whole $D=2$
axis. We conclude that the phase transition of Heisenberg helimagnets in
dimension 3 is either first order or second order with $O(4)$ exponents
involving a tensor representation or tricritical.

bosonic and superstring backgrounds related to coset conformal field theories.
A class of exact `left-right symmetric' solutions is obtained by supplementing
the metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton of the superstring solutions by
the gauge field background equal to the generalised Lorentz connection with
torsion. As in the superstring case, these backgrounds are $\a'$-independent,
i.e. have a `semiclassical' form. The corresponding heterotic string sigma
model is obtained from the combination of the (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNW
action with the action of internal fermions coupled to the target space gauge
field. The pure (1,0) supersymmetric gauged WZNW theory is anomalous and does
not describe a consistent heterotic string solution. We also find (to the order
$\alpha'^3$) a two-dimensional perturbative heterotic string solution with the
trivial gauge field background. To the leading order in $\alpha'$ it coincides
with the known $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ bosonic or superstring solutions. This solution
does not correspond to a `heterotic' combination of the left superstring and
right bosonic $L_0$-operators at the conformal field theory level. Some duality
properties of the heterotic string solutions are studied.

would eliminate some of the renormalization ambiguities which plague ordinary
bosonic (and $N=1$) dilaton gravity. To investigate this, the model is studied
in superconformal gauge, where it is found that one chiral term becomes
nonchiral, so that only one term is safe from renormalization.
