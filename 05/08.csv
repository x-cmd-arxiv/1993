relativistic combustion theory with a planar geometry. It is shown that such
burning is probably neither slow combustion nor simple detonation. Fast
combustion without detonation is possible under certain circumstances, but
would involve very efficient heat transfer mechanisms. It is found, however,
that the burning is most likely absolutely unstable with no well defined burn
front.

quantum electrodynamics, even when the bare gauge coupling is chosen large.
Simulations of the non-compact formulation of the lattice abelian Higgs model
with fixed length scalar fields on $L^{4}$ lattices with $L$ ranging from $6$
through $20$ indicate a line of second order critical points.
Fluctuation-induced first order transitions are ruled out. Runs of over ten
million sweeps for each $L$ produce specific heat peaks which grow
logarithmically with $L$ and whose critical couplings shift with $L$ picking
out a correlation length exponent of $0.50(5)$ consistent with mean field
theory. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that found in pure
$\lambda\phi^{4}$.

damping rate. The rate behaves as $\alpha_S^2(\ln 1/\alpha_S)^2 T^4$ when $m,

Configurations which are non-singular at the event horizon have non-vanishing
asymptotic energy density. Such solutions can be smoothly extended through the
event horizon and have non-vanishing energy flux emerging from the past
singularity. Dynamical processes will not change the amount of tachyon hair on
a black hole. In particular, there will be no tachyon hair on a black hole
formed in gravitational collapse if the initial geometry is the linear dilaton
vacuum. There also exist static solutions with finite total energy, which have
singular event horizons. Simple dynamical arguments suggest that black holes
formed in gravitational collapse will not have tachyon hair of this type.

the second window the massless bosonic excitation is a negative norm state
