arbitrary smooth projective threefolds. Let $X$ be a smooth projective
threefold over complex numbers, $L$ a very ample line bundle on $X$. Then we
prove that there is a positive integer $n_0(X,L)$ such that for $n \geq
n_0(X,L)$, the Noether-Lefschetz locus of the linear system $H^0(X,L^n)$ is a
countable union of proper closed subvarieties of $\P(H^0(X,L^n)^*)$ of
codimension at least two. In particular, the {\em general singular member} of
the linear system $H^0(X,L^n)$ is not contained in the Noether-Lefschetz locus.
  As an application of our main theorem we prove the following result: Let $X$
be a smooth projective threefold, $L$ a very ample line bundle. Assume that $n$
is very large. Let $S=\P(H^0(X,L^n)^*)$, let $K$ denote the function field of
$S$. Let ${\cal Y}_K$ be the generic hypersurface corresponding to the sections
of $H^0(X,L^n)$. Then we show that the natural map on codimension two cycles
  $$ CH^2(X_{\C}) \to CH^({\cal Y}_K) $$ is injective. This is a weaker version
of a conjecture of M. V. Nori, which generalises the Noether-Lefschetz theorem
on codimension one cycles on a smooth projective threefolds to arbitrary
codimension

antibody dynamics is formulated and analyzed. As in models with B cells only,
localized states exist in the network with limited numbers of activated clones
surrounded by virgin or near-virgin clones. The existence and stability of
these localized network states are explored as a function of model parameters.
As in previous models that have included antibody, the stability of immune and
tolerant localized states are shown to depend on the ratio of antibody to B
cell lifetimes as well as the rate of antibody complex removal. As model
parameters are varied, localized steady-states can break down via two routes:
dynamically, into chaotic attractors, or structurally into percolation
attractors. For a given set of parameters, percolation and chaotic attractors
can coexist with localized attractors, and thus there do not exist clear cut
boundaries in parameter space that separate regions of localized attractors
from regions of percolation and chaotic attractors. Stable limit cycles, which
are frequent in the two-clone antibody B cell (AB) model, are only observed in
highly connected networks. Also found in highly connected networks are
localized chaotic attractors. As in experiments by Lundkvist et al. (1989),
injection of $Ab_1$ antibodies into a system operating in the chaotic regime
can cause a cessation of fluctuations of $Ab_1$ and $Ab_2$ antibodies, a
phenomenon already observed in the two-clone AB model. Interestingly, chaotic
fluctuations continue at higher levels of the tree, a phenomenon observed by
Lundkvist et al. but not accounted for previously.

by an $SU(3)$-symmetric wavefunction renormalization, which explains the fact
that the ``corrected'' predictions still fit the data well. We argue that the

breaking down. Following a recent suggestion of Jenkins and Manohar, we then
include contributions from decuplet baryon intermediate states. Unlike these

find that the effects of $\Delta \ne 0$ significantly change the pattern of

octet contributions in a non-trivial way, but the corrections no longer favor
the $SU(6)$ values of the axial couplings. We also argue that $D$ and $F$ axial
