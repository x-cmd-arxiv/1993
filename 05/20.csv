to find the divergences in the polarization and the correlation length, and, to
first order in an $\epsilon = 4-d$ expansion, the diverging time scale. The
automaton models studied are a charge-density wave model and a ``sandpile''
model with periodic boundary conditions; these models are found to have the

numerical results for the polarization and the diverging length and time scales
