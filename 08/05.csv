an order of magnitude slower than known pulsators of comparable luminosity.
They cannot be stars undergoing simple radial pulsations. For one or more of
these stars we can discount the possibility that the variability is due to
rotational modulation of star spots, interactions with (or tidal distortions
by) a close companion, or obscuration by a rotating lumpy ring of dust orbiting
the star. They are certainly not eclipsing binaries. The only possibility left
seems to be non-radial pulsations, though this explanation involves
difficulties of its own. If they are indeed pulsating stars exhibiting non-
radial gravity modes, they would be the first stars on the cool side of the
Cepheid instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to be so
identified.

phase space distribution of massive neutrinos in linear perturbation theory.
The method provides a much more accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space
for the HDM initial conditions of N-body simulations in a cold+hot dark matter
universe than previous work. Instead of directly sampling the phase space at
the end of the linear era, we first compute the evolution of the metric
perturbations by numerically integrating the coupled, linearized Einstein,
Boltzmann, and fluid equations for all particle species. We then sample the
phase space shortly after neutrino decoupling at redshift z=10^9 when the
distribution is Fermi-Dirac. To follow the trajectory of each neutrino, we
subsequently integrate the geodesic equations for each neutrino in the
perturbed background spacetime from z=10^9 to z=13.55, using the linearized
metric found in the previous calculation to eliminate discreteness noise. The
positions and momenta resulting from this integration represent a fair sample
of the full neutrino phase space and can be used as HDM initial conditions for
N-body simulations of nonlinear structure evolution in this model. A total of
21 million neutrino particles are used in a 100 Mpc box, with Omega_cdm=0.65,
Omega_hdm=0.30, Omega_baryon=0.05, and Hubble constant H_0=50. We find that
correlations develop in the neutrino densities and momenta which are absent
when only the zeroth-order Fermi-Dirac distribution is considered.

different weights changes the configuration of the free energy surface. For a
general choice of weights not all of the patterns are stored as {\sl global}
minima of the free energy function. However, as for the case of the usual Hebb
rule, there exists a temperature range in which only the stored patterns are
minima of the free energy. In particular, in the presence of a single extra
pattern stored with an appropriate weight in the synaptic rule, the temperature
at which the spurious minima of the free energy are eliminated is significantly
lower than for a similar network without this extra pattern. The convergence
time of the network, together with the overlaps of the equilibria of the
