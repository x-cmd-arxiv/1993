objects (XSBLs) as determined from three years of monitoring 37 BL Lac objects
and candidates. The observed objects include a complete X-ray flux limited
sample drawn from the EMS Survey. The majority of the XSBLs classi- fied solely
on the appearance of their spectra are members of the class of BL~Lacs since
they possess intrinsically polarized and variable continua. The duty cycle of
polarized emission from XSBLs is 40\%. The majority of XSBLs ($\approx 85$\%)
have preferred polarization position angles on time scales as long as three
years. This reflects stability in the geometry of the region emitting the
polarized optical emission. We discuss the observed spectral dependence of the
degree of polarization and some of the possible mechanisms for producing the
observed characteristics. While dilution of the polarized emission by the host
galaxy starlight is present in some objects, we demon- strate that the average
polarization properties derived from our observations are not drastically
affected by this effect. The objects in our monitored sample did not display
the larger than one magnitude variations generally used to characterize the
optical variability of blazars in general.

The standard derivation of the sum over paths by discretizing the paths is
reviewed, and it is shown that the form $\sum \exp(iS[x])$ is justified only
for Schrodinger-type systems which are at most second order in the momenta.
Extending this derivation to the relativistic free particle, the causal Green's
function is expressed as a sum over timelike paths, and the Feynman Green's
function is expressed both as a sum over paths which only go one way in time
and as a sum over paths which move forward and backward in time. The weighting
of the paths is shown not to be $\exp(iS[x])$ in any of these cases. The role
of the inner product and the operator ordering of the wave equation in defining
the sum over histories is discussed.

investigated, taking into account one loop prefactors. In particular, we con-
sider the creation of membranes by an antisymmetric tensor field, analogous to
Schwinger pair production. This can be viewed as a model for the decay of false
(or true) vacuum at zero temperature, in the thin wall limit. Also considered
is the spontaneous nucleation of strings, domain walls and monopoles during
inflation. The instantons for these processes are spherical world-sheets or
world-lines embedded in flat or de Sitter backgrounds. We find the contribution
of such instantons to the semiclassical partition function, including one loop
corrections due to small fluctuations around the spherical worldsheet. We sug-
gest a prescription for obtaining the distribution of objects nucleated during
inflation. This can be seen as an extension of the usual formula, valid in flat
space, according to which the nucleation rate is twice the imaginary part of
the free energy. In addition, we use the method of Bogolubov transformations to
compute the rate of pair production by an electric field in 1+1 dimensional de
Sitter space, and compare the results to those obtained using the instanton me-
thod. Both results agree where they are expected to, not only in the exponen-
tial dependence but also in the prefactor, confirming the validity of instanton
techniques in de Sitter space. Throughout the paper, both the gravitational
field and the antisymmetric tensor field are assumed external.

an application of the formalism developed, quantization on coset spaces of
