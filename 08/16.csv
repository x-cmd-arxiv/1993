microwave background. To explore these changes, we derive from first principles
the equations governing anisotropies, focusing on the interactions of photons
with electrons. Vishniac (1987) claimed that second order terms can be large in
a re-ionized Universe, so we derive equations correct to second order in the
perturbations. There are many more second order terms than were considered by
Vishniac. To understand the basic physics involved, we present a simple
analytic approximation to the first order equation. Then turning to the sec-
ond order equation, we show that the Vishniac term is indeed the only important
one. We also present numerical results for a variety of ionization histories
[in a standard cold dark matter Universe] and show quantitatively how the sig-
nal in several experiments depends on the ionization history. The most
pronounced indication of a re-ionized Universe would be seen in very small
scale experiments; the expected signal in the Owens Valley experiment is
smaller by a factor of order ten if the last scattering surface is at a
redshift $z\simeq100$ as it would be if the Universe were re-ionized very
early. On slightly larger scales, the expected signal in a re-ionized Universe
{\it is} smaller than it would be with standard recombination, but only by a
factor of two or so.

pinning forces by analyzing spatial and temporal correlations in a lattice
model recently proposed by Sneppen [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 69}, 3539 (1992)].
The static and dynamic behavior of the model is related to the properties of
directed percolation. We show that, due to the interplay of local and global
growth rules, the usual method of dynamical scaling has to be modified. We
separate the local from the global part of the dynamics by defining a train of
causal growth events, or ""avalanche"", which can be ascribed a well-defined
dynamical exponent $z_{loc} = 1 + \zeta_c \simeq 1.63$ where $\zeta_c$ is the
roughness exponent of the interface. We observe that the avalanche size
distribution obeys a power-law decay with an exponent $\kappa \simeq 1.25$.

approximate symmetry. With an extended Higgs sector, large $\tan\beta$ can be
natural. We give an explicit example with four doublets in which it is possible
to achieve large $\tan\beta$ as a result of an approximate symmetry, without
any light superpartners. The approximate symmetry can be extended to explain
all the hierarchies in the quark mass matrix.

$n_1$ particles of another kind, where both initial and final particles are at

interaction and unequal masses. We find that these amplitudes are zero except
for the lowest possible $n_1$ and $n_2$, and that the cancellation of the
corresponding Feynman graphs occurs due to a special symmetry of the classical
mechanical counterpart of this theory. This feature is rather general and is
inherent in various other scalar field theories.

statistics, the (coarse-grained) entropy generation is {\em attenuated} when

For this we introduce a new procedure of obtaining the Ur-KdV equation, where
we require that it has no non-local operators. We extend this method to the
$SL(3)$ KdV equation, i.e., Boussinesq(Bsq) equation and obtain the hamiltonian
structure of Ur-Bsq equationin a simple form. In particular, we explicitly
construct the hamiltonian operator of the Ur-Bsq system which defines the
poisson structure of the system, through the Fr\'{e}chet derivative and its
inverse.
