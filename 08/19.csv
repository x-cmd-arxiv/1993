  Accretion?","PostScript, 10 pages",,"10.1093/mnras/266.3.681",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that the prevalence of bipolarity in Young Stellar Objects is due
to the fine tuning that is required for spherical accretion of an ambient
medium onto a central node.It is shown that there are two steady modes that are
more likely than radial accretion, each of which is associated with a
hyperbolic central point in the meridional stream lines, and consequently with
either an equatorial inflow and an axial ejection or vice versa. In each case
the stream lines pass through a thick accretion torus, which is better thought
of as a standing pressure wave rather than as a relatively inert Keplerian
structure.We base our arguments on a simple analytic example,which is topologi
cally generic,wherein each bipolarmode is created by the rebound of accreting
matter under the action of the thermal,magnetic,turbulent and centrifugal
pressures created in the flow. In both bipolar modes the presence of non-zero
angular momentum implies axial regions wherein the pressure is first reduced
below the value at infinity and then becomes negative, where the solution fails
because rotating material can not enter this region without suction.The model
thus has empty stems where the activity of the central source must dominate.So
the basic engine of the bipolar flow discussed here is simply the rebound of
freely falling material from a thick pressure disc into an axial low pressure
region.The low mass,high velocity outflow must be produced in this region by an
additional mechanism. This is reminiscent of the cored apple structure observed
recently in the very young bipolar source VLA 1623.

However, an apparent horizon lying in the vacuum region will always have non
vanishing area, as long as the ADM mass of the system is non zero. Furthermore
for density profiles not decreasing inwards, it appears that all spherical
trapped surfaces lie on a thick spherical shell. Finally for a uniform density

inflation. Models in which supersymmetry is dynamically broken by

hidden sector models suffer from several naturalness problems and have
difficulties in producing an acceptably large gluino mass.
