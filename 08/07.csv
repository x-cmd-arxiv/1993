for N holes in the t - J model on a non--square sqrt{8} X sqrt{32} 16--site
lattice with periodic boundary conditions; we justify the use of this lattice
in compariosn to those of having the full square symmetry of the bulk. This new
cluster has a high density of vec k points along the diagonal of reciprocal
space, viz. along k = (k,k). The results clearly demonstrate that when the
single hole problem has a ground state with a system momentum of vec k =
(pi/2,pi/2), the resulting ground state for N holes involves a shift of the
peak of the system's structure factor away from the antiferromagnetic state.
This shift effectively increases continuously with N. When the single hole
problem has a ground state with a momentum that is not equal to k =
(pi/2,pi/2), then the above--mentioned incommensurability for N holes is not
found. The results for the incommensurate ground states can be understood in
terms of rigid--band filling: the effective occupation of the single hole k =
(pi/2,pi/2) states is demonstrated by the evaluation of the single particle
momentum distribution function <n(q)>. Unlike many previous studies, we show
that for the many hole ground state the occupied momentum states are indeed k =
(+/- pi/2,+/- pi/2) states.

products of the excited hadron. The result hinges in part on a nonperturbative
parameter which measures the net transverse alignment of the light degrees of
freedom in the fragmentation process. We use existing data on charmed mesons to
extract this quantity for certain excited mesons. Using this result, we
estimate the polarization retention of charm and bottom baryons.

at zero temperature. If the radiation is emitted into a region that contains a
thermal distribution of photons, then the rate is increased by a factor
$1+N(\omega)$ where $N(\omega)$ is the Bose-Einstein function. The stimulated
emission changes the spectrum to $\alpha Td\omega/\omega^{2}$ for $\omega\ll
T$. If this were correct, an infinite amount of energy would be radiated in the
low frequency modes. This unphysical result indicates a breakdown of
perturbation theory. The paper computes the bremsstrahlung rate to all orders
of perturbation theory, neglecting the recoil of the charged particle. When the
perturbation series is summed, it has a different low-energy behavior. For
$\omega\ll\alpha T$, the spectrum is independent of $\omega$ and has a value
proportional to $d\omega/\alpha T$ .

spacetimes with a single horizon leads to a particle number density with a

find the true vacuum consistent with the complete semiclassical analysis of
quantum black holes. The theory is described by a ""microcanonical"" quantum
field theory with fixed energy E = M, the mass of the black hole.
Considerations making use of the microcanonical density matrix as well as the
idempotency condition show that particles in black hole backgrounds are
described by pure states, unlike the canonical formulation.

gravity can generate a nontrivial effective potential for the conformal factor
of the metric. It is based on a nonstandard regularization method, with the
cutoff being defined independently of the conformal factor. This mechanism
produces a coupling of the matter fields to a dilaton, and a complicated
interaction between matter, dilaton and metric. When it is applied to the
standard model, it gives an effective potential which can be used to predict
the top and Higgs masses. If the purely gravitational contribution to the
potential is added, the mass of the dilaton is of the order of Planck's mass
and the large hierarchy between the Planck and Fermi scales appears to be due
to the smallness of the Higgs-dilaton coupling.
