the radiative corrections, $\Ck$, to the Gross--Llewellyn Smith (GLS) sum rule,
in deep-inelastic lepton scattering, and the radiative corrections, $\Cr$, to
the Adler function of the flavour-singlet vector current, in $\ee$
annihilation. These include a surprising relation between the
scheme-independent single-electron-loop contributions to the 4-loop QED
$\beta$\/-function and the zero-fermion-loop abelian terms in the 3-loop GLS
sum rule. The combined effect of all 7 relations is to give the factorization
of the 2-loop $\beta$\/-function in
\[\Ds\equiv\Ck\Cr-1=\frac{\Be}{\Aq}\left\{S_1\Cf\Aq+\left[S_2\Tf\Nf
+\Sa\Ca+\Sf\Cf\right]\Cf\Aq^2\right\}+O(\Aq^4)\,,\] where
$\Aq=\al(\mu^2=Q^2)/4\pi$ is the $\MS$ coupling of an arbitrary colour gauge
theory, and \[S_1=-\Df{21}{2}+12\Ze3\,;\quad
S_2=\Df{326}{3}-\Df{304}{3}\Ze3\,;\quad
\Sa=-\Df{629}{2}+\Df{884}{3}\Ze3\,;\quad \Sf=\Df{397}{6}+136\Ze3-240\Ze5\]
specify the sole content of $\Ck$ that is not already encoded in $\Cr$ and
$\Be=Q^2\rd\Aq/\rd Q^2$ at $O(\Aq^3)$. The same result is obtained by combining
the radiative corrections to Bjorken's polarized sum rule with those for the
Adler function of the non-singlet axial current. We suggest possible origins of
$\beta$ in the `Crewther discrepancy', $\Ds$, and determine $\Ds/(\Be/\Aq)$, to
all orders in $\Nf\Aq$, in the large-$\Nf$ limit, obtaining the {\em entire\/}
series of coefficients of which $S_1$ and $S_2$ are merely the first two
members.

complete set of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ invariant operators up to dimension four
is considered. The two-point and three-point functions with external gauge
fields are derived from this effective chiral Lagrangian to one-loop order in a
generic $R_\xi$-gauge. The same set of Green's functions are paralelly studied
in the renormalizable standard model to one-loop order, in a $R_\xi$-gauge and
in the large Higgs mass limit. An appropriate set of matching conditions
connecting the Green's functions of the two theories allows us to derive,
systematically, the values of the chiral Lagrangian coefficients corresponding
to the large Higgs mass limit of the standard model. These chiral parameters
represent the non-decoupling effects of a heavy Higgs particle and incorporate
both the leading logarithmic dependence on $\mh$ and the next to leading
constant contributions. Some phenomenological implications are also discussed.

pseuso-scalars and photons propagating in 2-dimensional curved spacetime in
detail. For certain values of the coupling constants the theory reduces to the
gauged Thirring model and for others the Schwinger model incurved spacetime. It
is shown that the interaction of the fermions with the pseudo-scalars shields
the electromagnetic interaction, and that the non-minimal coupling of the
scalars to the gravitational field amplifies the Hawking radiation. We solve
the finite temperature and density model by using functional techniques and in
particular derive the exact equation of state. The explicit temperature and
curvature dependence of the chiral condensate is found. When the
electromagnetic field is switched off the model reduces to a conformal field
theory. We determine the physically relevant expectation values and conformal
weights of the fundamental fields in the theory.
