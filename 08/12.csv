  systems","20 pages LATEX. Figures available upon request from author",,,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  We consider the spectrum of the evolution operator for bound chaotic systems
by evaluating its trace. This trace is known to approach unity as $t
\rightarrow \infty$ for bound systems. It is written as the Fourier transform
of the logaritmic derivative of a zeta function whose zeros are identified with
the eigenvalues of the operator. Zeta functions are expected to be entire only
for very specific systems, like Axiom-A systems. For bound chaotic systems
complications arise due to e.g. intermittency and non completeness of the
symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent system an approximation of the zeta
function is derived. It is argued that bound systems with {\em long time tails}
have branch cuts in the zeta function and traces approaching unity as a
powerlaw. Another feature of bound chaotic systems, relevant for the
asymptotics of the trace, is that the dominant time scale can be much longer
than the period of the shortest periodic orbit. This the case for e.g. the
hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros of the zeta function for the hyperbola
billiard are evaluated by means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success
of this approach is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit
responsible for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
implications are discussed at the end.

With increasing field intensity the capacitance initially increases and after

mutual interplay of Anderson localization and superconductivity in strongly
disordered systems. We start with brief discussion of modern aspects of
localization theory including the basic concept of scaling, self-consistent
theory and interaction effects. After that we analyze disorder effects on
Cooper pairing and superconducting transition temperature as well as
Ginzburg-Landau equations for superconductors which are close to the Anderson
transition. A necessary generalization of usual theory of ``dirty''
superconductors is formulated which allows to analyze anomalies of the main
superconducting properties close to disorder-induced metal-insulator
transition. Under very rigid conditions superconductivity may persist even in
the localized phase (Anderson insulator).Strong disordering leads to
considerable reduction of superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and to
important anomalies in the behavior of the upper critical field H_{c2}.
Fluctuation effects are also discussed. In the vicinity of Anderson transition
inhomogeneous superconductivity appears due to statistical fluctuations of the
local density of states. We briefly discuss a number of experiments
demonstrating superconductivity close to the Anderson transition both in
traditional and high-T_{c} superconductors. In traditional systems
superconductivity is in most cases destroyed before metal-insulator transition.
In case of high-T_{c} superconductors a number of anomalies show that
superconductivity is apparently conserved in localized phase before it is
suppressed by strong enough disorder.

dynamical degree of freedom in quantum field theory. It has been argued that
the probability distribution for signature, induced by massless free fields, is
peaked at the Lorentzian value uniquely in D=4 dimensions. This argument is
reviewed, and certain consistency constraints on the generalized signature
(i.e. the tangent space metric
$\eta_{ab}(x)=\mbox{diag}[e^{i\theta(x)},1,1,1]$) are derived. It is shown that
only one dynamical ""Wick angle"" $\theta(x)$ can be introduced in the
generalized signature, and the magnitude of fluctuations away from Lorentzian
signature $\delta \theta = \pi - \theta$ is estimated to be of order
$(l_P/R)^3$, where $l_P$ is the Planck length, and $R$ is the length scale of
the Universe. For massless fields, the case of D=2 dimensions and the case of
supersymmetry are degenerate, in the sense that no signature is preferred. Mass
effects lift this degeneracy, and we show that a dynamical origin of Lorentzian
signature is also possible for (broken) supersymmetry theories in D=6
dimensions, in addition to the more general non-supersymmetric case in D=4
dimensions.
