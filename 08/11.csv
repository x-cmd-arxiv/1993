nature, and its spontaneous symmetry breaking scale can be as low as a few TeV.
Such a discrete symmetry also has interesting implications for how electroweak
symmetry is spontaneously broken, because the simplest version of the theory
requires two electroweak Higgs doublets rather than one in order to provide
acceptable values for quark and lepton masses. The effective theory generated
at electroweak-scale energies is thus a particular type of two-Higgs-doublet
model. We point out in this paper that the broken discrete symmetry imposes
very interesting constraints on the form of the Yukawa couplings between
physical Higgs bosons and quarks and leptons. In particular, we find that the
flavour-changing neutral Higgs couplings to down-sector quarks are proportional
to the neutrino Dirac mass matrix. If neutrinos are Dirac particles, then the
severe experimental upper bounds on their mass values renders tree-level
neutral flavour-changing Higgs effects on down-quark systems like
$K^0-\bar{K}^0$ negligibly small. We also discuss minimization of some relevant
Higgs potentials and some other pertinent phenomenological issues.

by introducing collective fields in a gauge-symmetric manner. Through
appropriate gauge fixings of this symmetry one can remove long-distance degrees
of freedom from the underlying theory, replacing them by the collective fields.
Applying this technique to QCD, we set out to extract the long-distance
dynamics in the pseudoscalar flavour singlet sector through a gauging (and
subsequent gauge fixing) of the $U(1)_A$ flavour symmetry which is broken by
the anomaly. By this series of exact transformations of a cut-off generating
functional for QCD, we arrive at a theory describing the long-distance physics
of a pseudoscalar flavour singlet meson coupled to the residual quark-gluon
degrees of freedom. As examples of how known low-energy physics can be
reproduced in this formulation, we rederive the Witten-Veneziano relation
between the $\eta'$ mass and the topological susceptibility, now for any value
