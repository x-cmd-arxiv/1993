coupling, introduced by Peet, Susskind and Thorlacius as the `charge hole'. But
we take the boundary of the strong coupling region to be first timelike, then
spacelike for a distance $X$, and then timelike again (to mimic the structure
of a black hole). For an incident charge pulse entering this `charge trap' the
charge and information get separated. The charge comes out near the endpoint of
the singularity. The `information' travels a well localised path through the
strong coupling region and comes out later.

the Axiom of Choice). In ZFC (set theory with AC), given any cardinals C and D,
either C <= D or D <= C. However, in ZF this is no longer so. For a given
infinite set A consider Seq(A), the set of all sequences of A without
repetition. We compare |Seq(A)|, the cardinality of this set, to |P(A)|, the
cardinality of the power set of A.
  What is provable about these two cardinals in ZF? The main result of this
paper is that
  ZF |- for all A: |Seq(A)| not= |P(A)|

  Furthermore, it is provable in ZF that if B is an infinite set, then
|fin(B)|<|P(B)|, even though the existence for some infinite set B^* of a
function f from fin(B^*) onto P(B^*) is consistent with ZF.

under GCH give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
universal graph of size lambda with no K(kappa), namely, if either kappa is
finite or cf(kappa)>cf(lambda). (Here K(kappa) denotes the complete graph on
kappa vertices.) The special case when lambda^{< kappa}= lambda was first
proved by F. Galvin. Next, we investigate the question that if there is no
universal K(kappa)-free graph of size lambda then how many of these graphs
embed all the other. It was known, that if lambda^{< lambda}= lambda (e.g., if
lambda is regular and the GCH holds below lambda), and kappa = omega, then this
number is lambda^+. We show that this holds for every kappa <= lambda of
countable cofinality. On the other hand, even for kappa = omega_1, and any
regular lambda >= omega_1 it is consistent that the GCH holds below lambda,
2^{lambda} is as large as we wish, and the above number is either lambda^+ or
2^{lambda}, so both extremes can actually occur.
