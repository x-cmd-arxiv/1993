quantum group covariant way is the subject of this review. The Bethe Ansatz
turns to be remarkably useful to implement quantum group symmetries and to
provide quantum group representations even when $q$ is a root of unity. We
start by solving the six-vertex model with fixed boundary conditions (FBC) that
guarantee exact $SU(2)_q$ invariance on the lattice. The algebra of the
Yang-Baxter (YB) and $SU(2)_q$ generators turns to close. The infinite spectral
parameter limit of the YB generators yields {\bf cleanly} the $SU(2)_q$
generators. The Bethe Ansatz states constructed for FBC are shown to be {\bf
highest weights} of $SU(2)_q$. The higher level Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE,
describing the physical excitations) are explicitly derived for FBC. We then
solve the RSOS($p$) models on the light--cone lattice with fixed boundary
conditions by disentangling the type II representations of $SU(2)_q$, at
$q=e^{i\pi/p}$, from the full SOS spectrum obtained through Algebraic Bethe
Ansatz. The RSOS states are those with quantum spin $J<(p-1)/2$ and no {\bf
singular} roots in the solutions of the BAE. We thus give a microscopic
derivation of the lattice $S-$matrix of the massive kinks and show that the

scattering of several GeV from nuclear matter. We consider separately the cases
of 'elastic' and 'inelastic' knockout of respectively a nucleon and a
non-nucleonic particle. For the former category FSI have been calculated, using
the first cumulant approximation of a relativistic generalization of the theory
of Gersch et al, including intermediate NN states states with produced hadrons.
We also discuss a formal expression for the first cumulant approximation on the
basis of the PWIA. FSI between an inelasticlly knocked-out particle and core
nucleons are neglected. We present two scaling analyses of the data, from which
the above 'inelastic' contributions have been been removed. The data expressed
in a relativistic West variable show scaling of a much better quality than the
same in the IA scaling variable. Predictions for inclusive cross sections in
the two first cumulant versions are presented and discussed. We make a critical
comparison of the above with the IA approach of Benhar et al and their results.

in the mean field theory, and find that this volume has large consequences on
the properties of hadronic matter under extreme conditions such as in
astrophysical objects and high energy heavy-ion collisions. It is shown that we
can reproduce the critical temperature $T_{c}\simeq 200$ MeV predicted by
lattice QCD calculations for the phase transition from hadronic matter to
quark-gluon plasma, by using parameters which are adjusted to fit all empirical
data for normal nuclear matter.
