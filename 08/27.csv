gamma-ray bursts exhibits sharp peaks at angular separations of $\lesssim
4\deg$ (Quashnock and Lamb 1993), and at $\gtrsim 176\deg$ (Narayan and Piran
1993). While an excess of very close pairs of bursts can naturally arise from
burst repetition or from a spatial correlation of the burst sources, a physical
explanation for an angular correlation on a scale of $\simeq 180\deg$ seems
inconceivable.
  We show that both sharp peaks in the correlation function can be explained by
a possible bias in the determination of the burst positions. A generic way is
described in which the suggested bias can be introduced into the burst
localization procedure, either through instrumental imperfection or through the
software analyses. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to show that the observed
correlation function can be reproduced by the suggested effect. We demonstrate
that the results can nicely agree with the observations even if only a fraction
of the bursts are subject to the bias.
  We emphasis that the only motivation for suggesting the existence of this
bias are the features found in the angular autocorrelation function. It does
not rule out the possibility that bursts repeat. The natural way in which such
bias, if it exists, explains both sharp peaks, and the various conceivable
causes for the origin of this bias, make the bias hypothesis worth considering.

background, but they are rare ($\approx 2/81$). If all candidate events prove
to be from $t \bar{t}$, an estimate follows for $P(m_t|rate)$, the probability
distribution for $m_t$. The one reported configuration allows an independent
estimate for $P(m_t|\mu^\pm e^\mp \,2jets)$. These two distributions are
compatible,yielding an estimate of about 122 GeV. Decay events ``1 energetic

central charge of Liouville theory is given by one-loop contribution, which is
equal to 1. Applied to the bosonic string, this result ensures the vanishing of
total conformal anomaly along the lines different from those presented by KPZ

worldsheet superconformal invariance has recently been used to calculate
superstring scattering amplitudes and prove their finiteness. In this paper, it
is shown that the N=2 stress-energy tensor for this Green-Schwarz action can be
constructed out of the stress-energy tensor and ghosts of the Neveu-
Schwarz-Ramond action by the standard twisting procedure. In other words, a
field redefinition is found from the GS matter fields into the NSR matter and
ghost fields which transforms the matter part of the two fermionic GS super-
conformal generators into the $b$ ghost and shifted BRST current of the NSR
string. In light-cone gauge, this field redefinition reduces to the usual one
relating the light-cone GS and NSR fields.
  Although this proves the equivalence of physical vertex operators in the two
superstring formalisms, multiloop amplitudes are easier to calculate using the
Green-Schwarz formalism since manifest spacetime supersymmetry eliminates the
need for spin cuts, GSO projections, and cutoffs in moduli space.

nucleon mean free path in nuclear matter is derived from this effective
Lagrangian taking diagrams up to fourth-order into account. For the nucleon
mean free path in finite nuclei, we make use of the density determined by the
RDHF calculation in the local density approximation. Our microscopic results
are in good agreement with the empirical data and predictions by Dirac
