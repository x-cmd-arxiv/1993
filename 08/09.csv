  figures available from the author, SUSSEX-AST 93/8-1",,"10.1093/mnras/268.1.253",,"astro-ph",,"  Orbits in triaxial ellipsoidal potentials precess about either the major or
minor axis of the ellipsoid. In standard perturbation theory it can be shown
that a circular orbit will precess about the minor axis if its angular momentum
vector lies in a region bounded by two great circles which pass through the
intermediate axis and which are inclined with minimum separation $i_T$ from the
minor axis. We test the accuracy of the standard formula for $i_T$ by
performing orbit integrations to determine $i_S$, the simulated turnover angle
corresponding to $i_T$. We reach two principal conclusions: (i) $i_S$ is
usually greater than $i_T$, by as much as 12 degrees even for moderate
triaxialities, $A/1.2<B<C/0.8$. This reduces the expected frequency of polar
rings. (ii) $i_S$ is not a single, well-defined number but can vary by a few
degrees depending upon the initial phase of the orbit. This means that there is
a reasonable probability for capture of gas onto orbits which precess about
both axes. Interactions can then lead to substantial loss of angular momentum
and subsequent infall to the galactic centre.

finding equivalents of the lattice structure that is employed in standard
quantum logic. Particular attention is given to `quasi-temporal' theories in
which the notion of time-evolution is less rigid than in conventional
Hamiltonian physics; theories of this type are expected to arise naturally in
the context of quantum gravity and quantum field theory in a curved space-time.
The quasi-temporal structure is coded in a partial semi-group of `temporal
supports' that underpins the lattice of history propositions. Non-trivial
examples include quantum field theory on a non globally-hyperbolic spacetime,
and a simple cobordism approach to a theory of quantum topology.
  It is shown how the set of history propositions in standard quantum theory
can be realised in such a way that each history proposition is represented by a
genuine projection operator. This provides valuable insight into the possible
lattice structure in general history theories, and also provides a number of
potential models for theories of this type.

consistent with the experimental data and with previous lattice determinations

B meson, showing a behaviour compatible with the predictions by the heavy quark
effective theory (HQET). Within large uncertainties, our results suggest that
$A_2/A_1$ increases with the heavy quark mass. We also get very rough estimates
