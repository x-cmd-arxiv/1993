spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ on a square lattice are investigated on the basis of the
local dimer order. The lattice is divided into square blocks consisting of the
quartet of spins. The spin variables and the Heisenberg Hamiltonian are
expressed in terms of the low-energy quartet variables. On the basis of the
Dyson-Maleev representation the spin-wave theory of the quartet state is
developed. The spectrum of the lower magnon excitations consists of three
degenerate modes with the energy gap $\Delta =0.17J$. The ground state energy
per spin $E/N =-0.6J$. This preprint repeats in the main the previous one but
it contains calculations of the basic corrections and therefore has complete
character.

final evaporation stage, when the black hole approaches the Planck regime, is a
term which explicitly violates unitarity in the non-gravitational sector. While
pure states remain pure, there is an increase in the degree of purity for
non-pure states in this sector. This result holds irrespective of whether full
quantum gravity respects unitarity or not.

measured value for the magnetic moment of the $\Omega^-$ is used to determine
the local counterterm for the magnetic moments. We compare the chiral
perturbation theory predictions for the magnetic moments of the decuplet with
those of the baryon octet and find reasonable agreement with the predictions of
the large--$N_c$ limit of QCD. The leading contribution to the quadrupole
moment of the $\Delta$ and other members of the decuplet comes from one--loop
graphs. The pionic contribution is shown to be proportional to $I_z$ (and so
will not contribute to the quadrupole moment of $I=0$ nuclei), while the
contribution from kaons has both isovector and isoscalar components. The chiral
logarithmic enhancement of both pion and kaon loops has a coefficient that
vanishes in the $SU(6)$ limit. The third allowed moment, the magnetic octupole,
is shown to be dominated by a local counterterm with corrections arising at two
loops. We briefly mention the strange counterparts of these moments.

the Weyl invariance to be satisfied. We give, in the $n = 1$ supersymmetric
case, two non-renormalization theorems from which we can relate the $u$
component of $M_{\mu}$ to the $\beta^G_{uu}$ function. We work out this $(u,u)$
component of the $\beta^G$ function and find a non-vanishing contribution at
four loops. Therefore, it turns out that at order $\alpha^{\prime 4}$, there
are in general non-vanishing contributions to $M_u$ that prevent us from
deducing superstring vacua in closed form.

composition while transforming light atomic nuclei into heavy ones. The atomic
nuclei are supposed to be in thermal equilibrium with the ambient plasma. The
majority of reactions among nuclei leading to a nuclear transformation are
inhibited by the necessity for the charged participants to tunnel through their
mutual Coulomb barrier. As theoretical knowledge and experimental verification
of nuclear cross sections increases it becomes possible to refine analytic
representations for nuclear reaction rates. Over the years various approaches
have been made to derive closed-form representations of thermonuclear reaction
rates (Critchfield 1972, Haubold and John 1978, Haubold, Mathai and Anderson
1987). They show that the reaction rate contains the astrophysical cross
section factor and its derivatives which has to be determined experimentally,
and an integral part of the thermonuclear reaction rate independent from
experimental results which can be treated by closed-form representation
techniques in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. In this paper
mathematical/statistical techniques for deriving closed-form representations of
thermonuclear functions will be summarized and numerical results for them will
be given. The separation of thermonuclear functions from thermonuclear reaction
rates is our preferred result. The purpose of the paper is also to compare
numerical results for approximate and closed-form representations of
thermonuclear functions. This paper completes the work of Haubold, Mathai, and
Anderson (1987).
