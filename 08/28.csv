radiation spectrum produced by near critical accretion onto a neutron star. The
flow dynamics and the transfer of radiation are self--consistently solved in
the case of a spherically symmetric, ``cold'', pure scattering flow, including
general relativity. A sequence of models, each characterized by the value of
the total observed luminosity, was obtained assuming that the spectrum at the
star surface is black body in shape. It is found that when the luminosity
approaches the Eddington limit dynamical effects become important shifting the
spectrum to the blue and producing a power--law, high--energy tail. The
relevance of these results in connection with the observed spectral properties
of LMXBs, and of Cyg X--2 in particular, are discussed.

in the bosonic case, except for the dilaton (multiplet), which appears as the
measure. (Based on a talk given at Strings '93, May 24-29, Berkeley, CA. A

Liouville exponentials --- that is the one of Gervais-Neveu (more recently
developed further by Gervais), Braaten-Curtright-Ghandour-Thorn, and Otto-Weigt
--- are equivalent since they are related by simple basis transformations in
the Fock space of the free field depending upon the zero-mode only. Second, the
GN-G expressions for quantum Liouville exponentials, where the $U_q(sl(2))$
quantum group structure is manifest, are shown to be given by q-binomial sums
over powers of the chiral fields in the $J=1/2$ representation. Third, the
Liouville exponentials are expressed as operator tau-functions, whose chiral
expansion exhibits a q Gauss decomposition, which is the direct quantum
analogue of the classical solution of Leznov and Saveliev. It involves q
exponentials of quantum group generators with group ""parameters"" equal to
chiral components of the quantum metric. Fourth, we point out that the OPE of
the $J=1/2$ Liouville exponential provides the quantum version of the Hirota
bilinear equation.
