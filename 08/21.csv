eventually be used to explain the abundances of \li6, \be9 and B in population
II stars. The present work differs from previous studies in that we have used a
more extensive reaction network. It is demonstrated that in the simplest
scenario the abundances of the light elements with $A\le7$ constrain the
separation of inhomogeneities to sufficiently small scales that the model is
indistinguishable from homogeneous nucleosynthesis and that the abundances of
\li6, \be9\ and B are then below observations by several orders of magnitude.
This conclusion does not depend on the \li7 constraint. We also examine
alternative scenarios which involve a post-nucleosynthesis reprocessing of the
light elements to reproduce the observed abundances of Li and B, while allowing
for a somewhat higher baryon density (still well below the cosmological
critical density). Future B/H measurements may be able to exclude even this
exotic scenario and further restrict primordial nucleosynthesis to approach the
homogeneous model conclusions.
