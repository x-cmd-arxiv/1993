Lorentz factors of the order of a few and are the parent population for BL~Lac
Objects is examined, with particular reference to the data on two FRI Radio
Galaxies, NGC~315 and NGC~6251. Conservation laws for an entraining
relativistic jet are derived and are used to determine a relationship between
Mach number and velocity for initially relativistic jets. One immediate
consequence of this relationship is that, if an initially relativistic jet is
decelerated to a transonic Mach number between, say 0.5 and 1.5, then its
velocity at this point is between 0.3 and 0.7 times the speed of light.
Analysis of the milliarcsecond and arcsecond data on NGC~315 and NGC~6251 shows
that the Lorentz factors of the core jets in these galaxies can be as high as
2-4 provided that the jet pressures are not much more than an order of
magnitude higher than the minimum pressures. Such Lorentz factors are more
plausible if the jets are inclined at $\sim 30$ degrees to the line of sight,
although larger angles would also be possible. For core Lorentz factors in the
range 2-4, the jets are mildly relativistic on the large scale and their
velocities are consistent with the jet brightness asymmetries being caused by
Doppler beaming. The Lorentz factors required for significant beaming of core
jets may be reconciled with subluminal motions of knots in the core if these
are reverse shocks advected by the jet. Moderate jet Lorentz factors are
possible if the shocks are normal and higher Lorentz factors are possible if
the shocks are oblique. This paper provides support for the idea that the
transition from two-sided to one-sided jets across the FRI/II break is due to
the transition from

  Paper presented at The First Stromlo Symposium: The Physics of Active
  Galaxies",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper focuses on two aspects of the Physics of Radio Galaxies in which
it has been proposed that relativistic beaming of radiation is necessary to
account for the observations. Physical arguments are presented which show that
it is quite plausible that the jets in FRI radio galaxies are relativistic on
the parsec scale and decelerate to subrelativistic flow on the kiloparsec
scale. On the other hand it is shown that beaming of the optical continuum from
the core of Centaurus~A is not necessary to account for the excitation of the
emission line filaments in the ISM of this galaxy. Models involving
autoionizing shocks produced by the interaction between a low Mach number jet
and dense clouds along its path are capable of explaining the morphology of the
filaments and the simultaneous high excitation and low excitation lines in
their spectra.

Explicit expressions for the Chern-Simons numbers of these selfgravitating
Yang-Mills solitons are derived, which involve only properties of irreducible
root systems and some information about the asymptotics of the solutions. It
turns out, as an example, that the Chern-Simons numbers are always
half-integers or integers for the gauge groups $SU(n)$. Possible physical
implications of these results, which are based on analogies with the unstable

largest possible contributions to $a^{susy}_\mu$ occur for the largest allowed

hadronic uncertainty ($\approx\pm1.75\times10^{-9}$). Therefore, the new E821

of parametrisation of configuration space which must be removed if the theory
is to make physical sense. For theories that have a local symmetry this also
leads to a breakdown in BRST invariance. We discuss in detail the cases of
Bosonic Strings and Yang-Mills theory, showing how this arbitrariness may be
removed by the use of a counter-term in the former case, and by
compactification on $S\sp 4$ in the latter.
