intermediate term prediction techniques, analogous to the pattern recognition
algorithms CN and M8 introduced and studied by Keilis-Borok et al., are more

several different quality functions Q which can be used to optimize the

breaks the electroweak symmetry, but also causes the scalar to develop a vacuum
expectation value. With the appropriate choice of the scalar's Yukawa
couplings, fermion masses are generated, giving us the conventional pattern of
flavor symmetry breaking. Although no explicit scalar mass term appears in the
full lagrangian of the model, the pseudoscalar states that remain in the
low-energy effective theory gain sufficient mass through technicolor
interactions to evade detection. We show that this model does not generate
unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents, and is consistent with the
experimental constraints on oblique electroweak radiative corrections. We
determine the experimentally allowed region of the model's parameter space, and
