  q(X) = \sum_d q_d(X)/d!
  Recently Kronheimer and Mroka have announced the result that the Donaldson
series of so called simple 4-manifolds can be written as
  q(X) = e^{Q/2}\sum_{i=1}^p a_i e^{K_i}
  where $Q$ is the intersection form and the $K_i \in H^2(X,\Z)$ are the {\it
Kronheimer-Mrowka classes}. We prove that for simple simply connected algebraic
surfaces the $K_i$ are algebraic classes and that they are closely related to
the canonical class $K_X$. For simple simply connected minimal surfaces of
general type we prove $K_i^2 \le K_X^2$ with equality if and only if $K_i = \pm
K_X$.
  Remark: although no gauge theory is used in this paper it should have a cross
reference with the as yet non existent e-print service for low dimensional
topology.

static transverse wandering length and at long times, we recover the
