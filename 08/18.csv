objects (MO), such as black holes with $M_\MO >>M_{stars}$, gravitational
scattering will lead to kinematic heating of the stars. Observational
constraints on the amount of heating in the disk of the Milky Way put upper
limits on $M_\MO \ltorder 10^{6.3}\msun $. We find limits that are three orders
of magnitude more stringent by examining the heating limits in low mass stellar
systems, where higher densities of dark matter and lower relative velocities
disperse the stars in less than a billion years. Specifically, the structure
and kinematics of the Local Group member GR8 yield a limit of $M_\MO \ltorder
6\times 10^{3}\msun$. If the properties of the dark matter are universal these
results preclude the dominance of dark matter constituents in the
cosmologically interesting mass range $\sim 10^6\msun$ and limit them to $M_\MO
\ltorder 10^{3.7}\msun$. These results also rule out massive compact halo
objects as significant contributors to the kinematic heating of the Galactic
disk.

Bank 140-foot radio telescope of 47 northern objects in the polar-ring galaxy
atlas of Whitmore \etal\ (1990). We detected 39 of these above our detection
limit of 1.7 \hbox{Jy\CDOT\KMS}; the average measured flux of 21 Jy\CDOT\KMS\
corresponds to an average neutral hydrogen mass of $\rm 5.3 \times 10^9$ \MSUN
for a Hubble constant of $\rm H_0 = 75$ \KMS \ Mpc$^{-1}$. For the polar-ring
galaxies in our sample that have also been observed with radio arrays, we find
that the 21\AMIN\ (FWHM) Green Bank beam often includes much more flux than
found by the synthesis instruments for the polar rings alone; some of these
galaxies are known to have gas-rich companions. We compare the neutral hydrogen
content of the sample to the blue luminosity and IRAS fluxes. The \HI-to-blue-
light ratios of the confirmed and probable polar rings are around unity in
solar units, indicating that polar ring galaxies (or their environments) are as
gas-rich as typical irregular galaxies. For their blue luminosity, the
confirmed polar rings are underluminous in the far-infrared, as compared with
the rest of the sample. They are also FIR-underluminous for their \HI\ masses,
which suggests that most of the gas in the ring may be in stable orbits, rather
than flowing inward to trigger star formation in the central galaxy. The more
disordered class of `related objects,' which includes a number of obvious
mergers, is highly luminous in the far-infrared.

richer when there are two parameters than in the various one-parameter models
that have been studied hitherto. We describe the intrinsic structure of the
point in the (compactification of the) moduli space that corresponds to the
large complex structure or classical limit. The instanton expansions are of
interest owing to the fact that some of the instantons belong to families with
continuous parameters. We compute the Yukawa couplings and their expansions in
terms of instantons of genus zero. By making use of recent results of
Bershadsky et al. we compute also the instanton numbers for instantons of genus
one. For particular values of the parameters the models become birational to
certain models with one parameter. The compactification divisor of the moduli
space thus contains copies of the moduli spaces of one parameter models. Our
discussion proceeds via the particular models $\P_4^{(1,1,2,2,2)}[8]$ and
$\P_4^{(1,1,2,2,6)}[12]$. Another example, $\P_4^{(1,1,1,6,9)}[18]$, that is
