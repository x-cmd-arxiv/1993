that the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, in which a large scale magnetic
field generates small scale eddys in a shearing environment, may be ultimately
responsible for this process. Although there is considerable controversy about
the origin and maintenance of this field in accretion disks, it turns out that
it is possible to argue, quite generally, using scaling arguments, that this
process is sensitive to the total pressure in an AGN disk, rather than the
pressure contributed by gas alone. We conclude that the resolution of the
conceptual difficulties implied by the presence of strong thermal and viscous
instabilities in radiation pressure and electron scattering dominated does not
lie in models that couple the total dissipation rate to the gas pressure alone,
or to some weighted mean of the gas and radiation pressures.

normalized by the COBE quadrupole measurement, and galaxies are identified from
the peaks of initial density fields above a certain threshold chosen, to match
the observed two-point correlation on scales $\ls 10\mpc$. Thus the clustering
properties of both the mass and the galaxies are completely specified. The
biasing parameter (for the `galaxies') determined in this way is $b_g\approx
1.2$ for Model I, 1.5 for Model II and 1.6 for Model III. The clustering and
motions of the simulated `galaxies' are compared with recent observations. The
spatial distributions of galaxies in the hybrid models are very frothy;
filaments, sheets, voids etc. of sizes 10 -- 50$\mpc$ are frequently seen in
the simulations.

implies: $m_{\chi^0_1}\lsim55\GeV$, $m_{\chi^0_2}\lsim100\GeV$, $m_{\tilde

the otherwise allowed region in the $(m_{\chi^\pm_1},\tan\beta)$ plane

  K\""{a}HLER-Lorentz Anomalies","37 pages, CERN-TH.6961/93","Nucl.Phys. B418 (1994) 535-570",,,"hep-th",,"  We present a manifestly supersymmetric procedure for calculating the
contributions from matter loops to the mixed K\""{a}hler-gauge and to the mixed
K\""{a}hler- Lorentz anomalies in $N=1, D=4$ supergravity-matter systems. We
show how this procedure leads to the well-known result for the mixed
K\""{a}hler-gauge anomaly. For general supergravity-matter systems the mixed
K\""{a}hler-Lorentz anomaly is found to contain a term proportional to ${\cal
R}^2$ with a background field dependent coefficient as well as terms
proportional to $(C_{mnpq})^2$ and to the Gauss-Bonnet topological density. We
briefly comment on the relationship between the mixed K\""{a}hler-Lorentz
anomaly and the moduli dependent threshold corrections to gravitational
couplings in $Z_N$ orbifolds.

nontrivial $M$-ideals in $L(L_p[0,1])$ if $p\neq 2$, and $K(\ell_p(\ell_q^n)$
is the only nontrivial $M$-ideal in $L(\ell_p(\ell_q^n)$. This proves a
conjecture of C.-M. Cho and W. B. Johnson.
