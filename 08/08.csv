$B(B\to K^*\gamma) = (6.8\pm 2.4)\cdot 10^{-5}$ for top--quark masses in the
range (150--200) GeV and $|V_{cb}| = 0.035$ for $\tau_B = 1.5\,\text{ps}$. The
ratio to the inclusive rate is $B(B\to K^*\gamma)/B(B\to X_s\gamma) = (20\pm

intermediate energies $ E_{lab}\le 1000 MeV/u$ of the projectile. and derive
expressions more general than previous results obtained by Neuhauser which were
limited to the case of isotropic systems. We find that the two-photon
correlation function strongly depends not only on the space-time properties of
the collision region but also on the dynamics of the proton-neutron scattering
process in nuclear matter. As a consequence of polarisation correlations it
turns out that for a purely chaotic source the intercept of the correlation
function of photons can reach the value $3$ (as compared with the maximum value
$2$ for isotropic systems). Furthermore even for ``hard"" photons ($E_{\gamma} >
25 MeV$) the maximum of the correlation function can reach the value of $2$ in
contrast with the value of $1.5$ derived by Neuhauser for this case. The
formulae obtained in this paper which include also the possible presence of a
coherent component can be used as a basis for a systematic analysis of photon
intensity-interferometry experiments.

applying the principle of general covariance to the Liouville action in the
context of a particular form of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The resultant
field equations form a closed system for the Liouville/gravity interaction. A
large class of asymptotically flat solutions to the field equations is
obtained, many of which can be interpreted as black hole solutions. The
temperature of such black holes is proportional to their mass-parameters. An
exact solution to the back reaction problem is obtained to one-loop order, both
for conformally coupled matter fields and for the quantized metric/Liouville
system. Quantum effects are shown to map the space of classical solutions into
one another. A scenario for the end-point of black-hole radiation is discussed.
