  originally posted in 1993, is unchanged. A 6-page appendix was added in 2000.
  It discusses implications to the original arguments of subsequent work of
  Sonego (J. Math. Phys. 40(1999), 3381-3394, and of Quinn and Wald (Phys. Rev.

  stylistic changes",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Original abstract: Consider the worldline of a charged particle in a static
spacetime. Contraction of the time-translation Killing field with the retarded
electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor gives a conserved electromagnetic energy
vector which can be used to define the radiated electromagnetic energy. This
note points out that for a conformally flat spacetime, the radiated energy is
the same as for a flat spacetime (i.e. Minkowski space). This appears to be
inconsistent with an equation of motion for such particles derived by DeWitt
and Brehme and later corrected by Hobbs [End of original abstract]
  New abstract: Same as old abstract with last sentence deleted. The body of
the paper is the same as previously. A new Appendix 2 has been added discussing
implications to the previous arguments of recent work of Sonego (J. Math. Phys.
40 (1999), 3381-3394) and of Quinn and Wald (Phys. Rev. D 60 (1999),
