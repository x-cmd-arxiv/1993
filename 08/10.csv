distribution function (PDF), using an analytic approximation that combines
gravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth expansion of the PDF. Our
method applies directly to a smoothed mass density field or to the divergence
of a smoothed peculiar velocity field, provided that rms fluctuations are small
compared to unity on the smoothing scale, and that the primordial fluctuations
that seed the growth of structure are Gaussian. We use this `Edgeworth
approximation' to compute the evolution of $<\delta|\delta|>$ and $<|delta|>$;
these measures are similar to the skewness and kurtosis of the density field,
but they are less sensitive to tails of the probability distribution, so they
may be more accurately estimated from surveys of limited volume. We compare our
analytic calculations to cosmological N-body simulations in order to assess
their range of validity. When $\sigma \ll 1$, the numerical simulations and
perturbation theory agree precisely, demonstrating that the N-body method can
yield accurate results in the regime of weakly non-linear clustering. We show
analytically that `biased' galaxy formation preserves the relation $<\delta^3>
\propto <\delta^2>^2$ predicted by second-order perturbation theory, provided
that the galaxy density is a local function of the underlying mass density.

correlation function $\xi(r_p,\pi)$ as a function of separations parallel
($r_p$) and perpendicular ($\pi$) to the line of sight. We find that the
relative velocity dispersion of pairs of IRAS galaxies is $\sigma(r)=
317^{+40}_{-49}$ \kms at $r=1 \mpc$, consistent with previous estimates derived
from optically selected galaxy catalogues. Unfortunately, the use of this
result to estimate $\Omega$ via the Cosmic Virial Theorem is thwarted by large
systematic uncertainties. We also fit for the mean relative streaming velocity
of pairs, $v_{12}(r)$, which describes the growth of fluctuations on both
linear and nonlinear scales. We find that $v_{12}(r) = 167^{+99}_{-67}$ \kms at
$r=4$\mpc, so that on average, approximately half the Hubble expansion velocity
of pairs at this separation is canceled by infall. At $r=10$\mpc, the amplitude
of the streaming is lower and $v_{12}(r) = 109^{+64}_{-47} \kms$. Linear
perturbation theory then implies that $\Omega^{0.6}/b =0.45^{+0.27}_{-0.18}$ on
scales $\sim 10-15 \mpc$. The amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ is sensitive to the
assumed shape of $\sigma(r)$; if the latter deviates substantially from a
virialized form on small scale, our best fit amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ can
deviate by a factor of two.

calculating the Lyapunov exponents of the transfer matrix. A detailed
finite-size scaling analysis is used to study the critical behavior near the
center of the Landau bands. The influence of varying the impurity
concentration, the scattering potential range and its nature, and the Landau
level index on the scaling behavior and on the critical exponent is
systematically investigated. Particular emphasis is put on studying the effects
of finite range of the disorder potential and Landau level coupling on the
quantum localization behavior. Our numerical results, which are carried out on
systems much larger than those studied before, indicate that pure
$\delta$-function disorder in the absence of any Landau level coupling gives
rise to non-universal localization properties with the critical exponents in
the lowest two Landau levels being substantially different. Inclusion of a

  We will be mainly concerned here with the ``geometry'' of {\it finite
dimensional\/} operator spaces. In the Banach space category, it is well known
that every separable space embeds isometrically into $\ell_\infty$. Moreover,
if $E$ is a finite dimensional normed space then for each $\vp>0$, there is an
integer $n$ and a subspace $F\subset \ell^n_\infty$ which is
$(1+\vp)$-isomorphic to $E$, i.e. there is an isomorphism $u\colon \ E\to F$
such that $\|u\|\ \|u^{-1}\|\le 1+\vp$. Here of course, $n$ depends on $\vp$,
say $n=n(\vp)$ and usually (for instance if $E = \ell^k_2$) we have $n(\vp)\to
\infty$ when $\vp\to 0$.
  Quite interestingly, it turns out that this fact is not valid in the category
of operator spaces:\ although every operator space embeds completely
isometrically into $B(H)$ (the non-commutative analogue of $\ell_\infty$) it is
not true that a finite dimensional operator space must be close to a subspace
of $M_n$ (the non-commutative analogue of $\ell^n_\infty$) for some $n$. The
main object of this paper is to study this phenomenon.
