cousin-model to extended inflation are studied. It is shown that, unlike
earlier results, Induced-gravity Inflation can lead to successful inflation
with a very simple lagrangian and $\lambda \sim 10^{-6}$, rather than
$10^{-15}$ as previously reported. A second order phase transition further
enables this model to escape the \lq big bubble' problem of extended inflation,
while retaining the latter's motivations based on the low-energy effective
lagrangians of supergravity, superstring, and Kaluza-Klein theories.

QCD phase transition, we consider quenching in the O(4) linear sigma model. We
summarize arguments and numerical evidence which show that in the period
immediately following the quench arbitrarily long wavelength modes of the pion
field are amplified. This results in large regions of coherent pion
oscillations, and could lead to dramatic phenomenological consequences in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. My talk was a description of work done
with Frank Wilczek. In these proceedings, I sketch our central results,
emphasizing several points that were raised in discussions at the conference.

  Supersymmetric Standard Model","9 pages + 1 figure (not included), Latex, MPI-Ph/93-35",,,,"hep-ph",,"  I analyze the predictions for the strong gauge coupling, $\alpha_3(M_Z) $,
and the top quark and light Higgs masses in the framework of gauge and
bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model. These predictions depend on the effective supersymmetric threshold scale
$T_{SUSY}$, which is only very slightly dependent on the squark and slepton
masses, and strongly dependent on the Higgsino masses as well as on the mass
ratio of the gauginos of the strong and weak interactions. Within the minimal
supersymmetry breaking scheme and for supersymmetric masses below or of the
order of 1 TeV, I obtain $\alpha_3(M_Z) \geq 0.116$, while, if the running
bottom quark mass at the physical mass is constrained to be $ m_b(M_b) \leq 4.1
$GeV, then, for moderate values of $\tan \beta$, perturbative unification is
achieved only if $\alpha_3(M_Z) \leq 0.124$. Unification of gauge and
bottom-tau Yukawa couplings yield predictions for the top quark mass, 140 GeV
$\leq M_t \leq 210 $ GeV for $1 \leq \tan \beta \leq 30$, which are remarkably
close to the infrared quasi fixed point values for this quantity. For the light
Higgs mass I obtain $m_h \leq 130(165)$ GeV if the characteristic squark mass
is below 1 (10) TeV.
