We discuss the behavior of the model in the context of current questions in
seismology. Some of the topics considered include: (1) basic properties of the
model, such as the magnitude vs. frequency distribution and the distinction
between small and large events; (2) dynamics of individual events, including
dynamical selection of rupture propagation speeds; (3) generalizations of the
model to more realistic, higher dimensional models; (4) studies of
predictability, in which artificial catalogs generated by the model are used to
test and determine the limitations of pattern recognition algorithms used in
seismology.

tracing out the spiralling inwards of gas in a large accretion flow towards the
Galactic Center (Linden et al. 1993, Biermann et al. 1993) in the radial
distance range from a few parsec to a few hundred pc. The required effective
viscosity corresponds well to the observed turbulent velocities and
characteristic length scales. The implied mass influx provides indeed all the
material needed to maintain the presently observed star formation rate at
distances closer than about $100$ pc. We argue that the energy input from
supernova explosions due to the high rate of star formation can feed the
turbulence of the interstellar medium. This then keeps the effective viscosity
high as required to feed the star formation. We suggest that this process leads
to limit cycles in star formation, and as a consequence also to limit cycles in
the feeding of any activity at the very center.
