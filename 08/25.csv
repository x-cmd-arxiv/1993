barely heavier than the intermediate vector bosons. As their non-supersymmetric
counterparts, they lead to many relations among low energy observables. But the
precise form of the predictions is modified by the extended spectrum. If the
masses of these new particles are comparable to $M_Z$, the standard computation
of their effect becomes inaccurate. We present a detail discussion of the
correct procedure, and carry out the relevant computations to one loop order.
The procedure we propose has the advantage over other existing methods that
two-loop running of gauge couplings can be incorporated readily and
consistently. Attention is paid to the special treatment that the top and Higgs
particles must receive. The size of the effect is explored for a range of
parameters in the minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand-unified theory with
radiative breaking. It is found that the naive (leading-log) computation can be
fairly inaccurate.

  LBL-33531","Phys.Rev.D49:3660-3690,1994","10.1103/PhysRevD.49.3660",,"hep-ph",,"  A new approach for deducing the theory of fermion masses at the scale of
grand unification is proposed. Combining SO(10) grand unification, family
symmetries and supersymmetry with a systematic operator analysis, the minimal
set of fermion mass operators consistent with low energy data is determined.
Exploiting the full power of SO(10) to relate up, down and charged lepton mass
matrices, we obtain predictions for 7 of the mass and mixing parameters. The
assumptions upon which the operator search and resulting predictions are based
are stressed, together with a discussion of how the predictions are affected by
a relaxation of some of the assumptions.The masses of the heaviest generation,
$m_t,m_b$ and $m_\tau$, are generated from a single renormalizable Yukawa
interaction, while the lighter masses and the mixing angles are generated by
non-renormalizable operators of the grand unified theory. The hierarchy of
masses and mixing angles is thereby related to the ratio of grand to Planck
scales, $M_G / M_P$. An explicit realization of the origin of such an
economical pattern of operators is given in terms of a set of spontaneously
broken family symmetries. In the preferred models the top quark is found to be
heavy: $M_t = 180 \pm 15$ GeV, and $\tan \beta$ is predicted to be very large.
Predictions are also given for $m_s, m_s/m_d , m_u/m_d, V_{cb}, V_{ub}/V_{cb}$
and the amount of CP violation. Stringent tests of these theories will be
achieved by more precise measurements of $M_t, V_{cb}, \alpha_s$ and $
V_{ub}/V_{cb}$ and by measurements of CP violation in neutral B meson decays.

the feasability of the model when the breaking of supersymmetry is parametrized
by the soft terms suggested by supergravity theories. In such models, the
electroweak symmetry is exact at tree level and is broken spontaneously at one
loop order. We make the additional assumption that the GUT-inspired relation
$m_b=m_\tau$ be valid at the scale where the gauge coupling constants unify,
which constrains the value of the top quark mass. For all types of soft
breaking terms expected in supergravity theories, we present the results of
numerical runs which yield electroweak breaking at the required scale. These
yield not only the allowed ranges for the soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters, but also the value of the supersymmetric partner' masses. For
example in the strict no-scale model, in which global supersymmetry breaking
arises solely from soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, but also the value
of the supersymmetric partner' masses. For example in the strict no-scale
model, in which global supersymmetry breaking arises solely from soft gaugino
masses, we find that $M_t$ can be no heavier than $\sim 127$ GeV.
