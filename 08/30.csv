hydrodynamics for Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and Lattice BGK methods in
two and three dimensions, as a function of the collision parameters of these
models. Our analysis is based on the wave-number dependence of the evolution
operator. Good ranges of validity are found for BGK models as long as the
relaxation time is chosen smaller than or equal to unity. The additional
freedom in the choice of collision parameters for LBE models does not seem to
give significant improvement.

the weak corrections are dominated by the leading universal corrections, at
high energies we find large, non-universal corrections, which arise from vertex

describing the meson physics in the low energy limit, it is tempting to find
the fully relativistically structured nucleon solution in the same model under
the similar approximation employed in the mesonic sector. To achieve this goal
we need to solve a relativistic Faddeev equation. The factorizability of the
two-body T-matrix reduces the three-body Faddeev equation to a tractable
two-body Bethe-Salpeter equation. The reduced equation is then solved
numerically. Our result indicates that the nucleon consists of three loosely
bound constituent quarks.

Hamiltonian reduction point of view. The Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) reduction scheme
is generalized to arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings thus showing that a large class
of W algebras can be viewed as reductions of affine Lie algebras. The
hierarchies of integrable evolution equations associated to these classical W
algebras are constructed as well as the generalized Toda field theories which
have them as Noether symmetry algebras. The problem of quantising the DS
reductions is solved for arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings and it is shown that any W
algebra can be embedded into an affine Lie algebra. This also provides us with
an algorithmic method to write down free field realizations for arbitrary W
algebras. Just like affine Lie algebras W algebras have finite underlying
structures called `finite W algebras'. We study the classical and quantum
theory of these algebras, which play an important role in the theory of
ordinary W algebras, in detail as well as some aspects of their representation
theory. The symplectic leaves (or W-coadjoint orbits) associated to arbitrary
finite W algebras are determined as well as their realization in terms of
bosoic oscillators. Apart from these technical aspects we also review the
potential applications of W symmetry to string theory, 2-dimensional critical
phenomena, the quantum Hall effect and solitary wave phenomena. This work is
based on the Ph.D. thesis of the author.
