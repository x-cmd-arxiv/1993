perturbative approach, where the values of the potential and its derivatives
are calculated as an expansion in departures from the slow-roll approximation.
They can then be expressed in terms of observable quantities, such as the
square of the ratio of the gravitational wave amplitude to the density
perturbation amplitude, the deviation of the spectral index from the
Harrison--Zel'dovich value, etc. Here, we calculate complete expressions for
the second-order contributions to the coefficients of the expansion by
including for the first time corrections to the standard expressions for the

We obtained a scan along the major axis for +/-5' (+/- 15 kpc) about the
galactic center, and some scans perpendicular to the galactic plane. The radial
density distribution shows a dense molecular gas ring of 5 kpc radius, which is
associated with an HI ring. The molecular disk comprises two components: an
unresolved thin and dense disk, and a thick disk (or a halo) extending to a
height greater than 1.4 kpc. The position-velocity diagram shows that the
general rotation of the entire galaxy is circular with a flat rotation curve.
However, the radial distribution of molecular gas is asymmetric with respect to
the galaxy center in the sense that the molecular gas is much richer in the NW
side. We derived a radial variation of \htwo-to-(HI+ \htwo) density ratio, and
found that int erstellar gas in the central 4 kpc region is almost entirely H2,

increases towards lower luminosities. At the lower mass end (0.4-0.2 M$\sun$),
the observed luminosity of the Li burning turning point is about a factor 4
higher than predicted by the models. At masses 1.2-1.0 M$\sun$ the observations
imply less PMS Li burning than theoretically expected. Moreover we show that:
1)Low Li abundances appear only among stars with low $v\sin{i}$. Fast rotators
with masses around 0.8~M$\sun$ do not show evidence for strong Li depletion
towards lower luminosities as slow rotators do. 2)In a sample restricted to
only K5-K7 stars we find that the angular momentum spread before Li burning
begins is larger than a factor 10. Lithium depletion associated to angular
momentum loss during PMS evolution is not required to explain the observed
abundances. The efficiency of PMS Li burning in the mass range 0.9-0.7~M$\sun$
is reduced in the presence of rapid rotation.

8979 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$O to $A=339$. The calculations are based on the
finite-range droplet macroscopic model and the folded-Yukawa single-particle
microscopic model. Relative to our 1981 mass table the current results are
obtained with an improved macroscopic model, an improved pairing model with a
new form for the effective-interaction pairing gap, and minimization of the
ground-state energy with respect to additional shape degrees of freedom. The
values of only 9 constants are determined directly from a least-squares
adjustment to the ground-state masses of 1654 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$O to
$^{263}$106 and to 28 fission-barrier heights. The error of the mass model is
0.669~MeV for the entire region of nuclei considered, but is only 0.448~MeV for
the region above $N=65$.
