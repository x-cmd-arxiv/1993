with a finite density of spin-down electrons is studied using the quantum

the Edwards wavefunction ansatz, and the standard second order perturbation
theory. We performed simulations up to 242 sites at $U/t=4$ reaching the zero
temperature properties with no ``fermion sign problem'' and found a
surprisingly good accuracy of the Edwards wavefunction ansatz at low density or
low doping. The conjugate gradient method was then applied to system up to 1922
sites and infinite $U$ for the Edwards state. Fermi liquid theory seems to
remain stable in 2D for all cases studied with the exception of the half
filling case where a ``Luttinger like behavior'' survives in the Hubbard model
, yielding a vanishing quasiparticle weight in the thermodynamic limit.

smallness of these corrections results from the cancellation of a large
positive contribution from the heavy top quark and large negative contributions
from all other virtual particles. It is precisely the non-observation of
electroweak radiative corrections that places stringent upper and lower limits
on the top mass.

of the inclusive decay rates and distributions in the processes \bgamaxs~ and
\Bsell ~($B=B^\pm$ or $B^0_d$). We show how measurements of the decay rates and
distributions in these processes would allow us to extract the magnitude and
sign of the dominant Wilson coefficients of the magnetic moment operator $\mb
\bar{s}_L \sigma_{\mu \nu} b_R F^{\mu \nu }$ and the four-fermion operators
$(\bar{s}_L \gamma_\mu b_L)(\bar{\ell} \gamma^{\mu} \ell)$ and $(\bar{s}_L
\gamma_\mu b_L)(\bar{\ell} \gamma^{\mu}\gamma^5 \ell)$. Non-standard-model
effects could thus manifest themselves at low energy in rare $B$ decays through
the Wilson coefficient having values distinctly different from their
standard-model counterparts. We illustrate this possibility using the examples
of the two-doublet Higgs models and the minimal supersymmetric models. The
dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the forward-backward asymmetry of $\ell^+$
in the centre-of-mass system of the dilepton pair in the decay \Bsell ~are also
worked out for the standard model and some representative solutions for the
other two models.

by a simple actional $I(S)$ (that is, an action for the action $S$) whose
equation of motion gives the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation for $S$.
Upon quantization we find that our new formulation is reduced to something like
a topological field theory having a BRST exact gauge-fixed actional. Therefore
the present formulation can reproduce ordinary gauge theories since the
path-integral over $S$ is dominated by the classical configuration which
satisfies the BV master equation. This ``theory of theories'' formulation is
intended to be applied to closed string field theory.

  a new section on non-Abelian gauge fields. (36 pages, latex, no figures)",,,"TAUP-2076-93","hep-th",,"  In 1948, Feynman showed Dyson how the Lorentz force and Maxwell equations
could be derived from commutation relations coordinates and velocities. Several
authors noted that the derived equations are not Lorentz covariant and so are
not the standard Maxwell theory. In particular, Hojman and Shepley proved that
the existence of commutation relations is a strong assumption, sufficient to
determine the corresponding action, which for Feynman's derivation is of
Newtonian form. Tanimura generalized Feynman's derivation to a Lorentz
covariant form, however, this derivation does not lead to the standard Maxwell
theory either. Tanimura's force equation depends on a fifth ({\it scalar})
electromagnetic potential, and the invariant evolution parameter cannot be
consistently identified with the proper time of the particle motion. Moreover,
the derivation cannot be made reparameterization invariant; the scalar
potential causes violations of the mass-shell constraint which this invariance
should guarantee. In this paper, we examine Tanimura's derivation in the
framework of the proper time method in relativistic mechanics, and use the
technique of Hojman and Shepley to study the unconstrained commutation
relations. We show that Tanimura's result then corresponds to the
five-dimensional electromagnetic theory previously derived from a
Stueckelberg-type quantum theory in which one gauges the invariant parameter in
the proper time method. This theory provides the final step in Feynman's
program of deriving the Maxwell theory from commutation relations; the Maxwell
theory emerges as the ``correlation limit'' of a more general gauge theory, in
which it is properly contained.
