diverging flows in low-density regions, based on the fact that large outflows
are not expected in a low-$\Omega$ universe. The velocities are assumed to be
induced by gravity from small initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made
regarding their exact Gaussian nature, galaxy biasing, or $\Lambda$. The
derivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to
the mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of $\Omega$ is
assumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the
assumed $\Omega$ is too low, thus bounding $\Omega$. Observed radial peculiar
velocities of galaxies allow the \pot\ procedure to recover the required
velocity field, Gaussian smoothed at $1200\kms$. The density and the associated
errors are then inferred for different values of $\Omega$, searching for a void
which shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary
application to data in a southern void indicates that $\Omega\leq 0.3$ can be
ruled out at the $2.4$-sigma level. A detailed study of possible systematic
errors is under way.

ingredients: a Black Hole ($M_\bullet\sim10^6M_\odot$), an accretion disk
($10^{-8.5} - 10^{-7} M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and a powerful jet (jet power $\ge$
10\% disk luminosity). However, the degree of activity is very low and can
barely account for the energetics of the whole central region. Neverthelss, in
the very inner arsecond the central engine becomes dominant and provides an
interesting laboratory for the physics of central engines (Black Holes) in
galactic nuclei. We therefore give an overall picture of the central arcsecond
where we link the radio emission and the heating of the ambient medium to a
weakly accreting disk surrounding a massive Black Hole. <<<To appear in the

discovery of an elongated structure at 43 GHz and increasing evidence for the
presence of an accretion disk surrounding a Black Hole lead us to assume that
both, an accretion disk and a jet, are present in the Galactic Center and are
physically linked. We model the radio emission of Sgr A* successfully with a
Blandford & K""onigl type jet and analyze the energetics of the coupled jet-disk
system in Sgr A* where jet and disk are parametrized in terms of the accretion
power. With this method we are able to confirm independently the lower limit of
the Sgr A* accretion rate \dot M >> 10^-8.5 M_sun found previously. Moreover,
using the limits imposed by observational data, we show that within such a
jet-disk model, the total jet power Q_jet is of comparable order as the
radiated disk luminosity L_disk. A jet model together with the assumption of an
10^6 M_sun Black Hole also qualitatively explains the submm excess and the lack
of non-thermal IR radiation. The small size of the visible part of the jet (< 1
mas) is due to the low accretion rate of Sgr A*. <<<A&A Letters, in press>>>

discussed, and, contrary to a previous claim, the baryon fraction is high,
relative to the constraints from baryonic nucleosynthesis. A general theory of
the fundamental surface of groups is presented, allowing one to determine with
reasonable confidence the precise cosmo-dynamical state of a given group of
galaxies. The data from groups is then consistent with a universal true $M/L$
of $440\,h$, roughly 4 times larger than previous estimates, the discrepancy
occurring because most groups are still relatively near cosmological
turnaround. This high $M/L$ and the young cosmo-dynamical state of groups
suggests a density parameter $\Omega > 0.3$. Hickson's compact groups are
explained as a mixture of virialized groups, loose groups near full collapse,
and chance alignments from collapsing loose groups. Finally, the level of
projection effects contaminating samples of binary galaxies within groups is
shown to be important.

and Yukawa coupling unification including the most up-to-date numerical
analyses, soft supersymmetry breaking, and radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking enforced using the tree-level and one-loop effective potentials. This
class of supersymmetric models can be described in terms of five parameters:
the top-quark mass ($m_t$), the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values
($\tan\beta$), and three universal soft-supersymmetry-breaking parameters
($m_{1/2},m_0,A$). Thus, highly correlated predictions can be expected for all
conceivable experimental observables. In effect, these general models provide a
basic framework upon which more constrained models can be built.

only vacuum-independent evidence of low-energy physics in string theory beyond
the supersymmetric standard model. The only assumptions behind this result are
(i) softly broken supersymmetry at low energies with zero cosmological
constant, (ii) these particles interact with gravitational strength and the
scalar components have a flat potential in perturbation theory, which are
well-known properties of string theories. (iii) They acquire a $vev$ of the
order of the Planck scale (as required for the correct value of the gauge
coupling constants and the expected compactification scale) after supersymmetry
gets broken. We explore the cosmological implications of these particles.
Similar to the gravitino, the fermionic states may overclose the Universe if
they are stable or destroy nucleosynthesis if they decay unless their masses
belong to a certain range or inflation dilutes them. For the scalar states it
is known that the problem cannot be entirely solved by inflation, since
oscillations around the minimum of the potential can lead to a huge entropy
generation at late times. We discus some possible ways to alleviate this
entropy problem, that favour low-temperature baryogenesis, and also comment on
the possible role of these particles as dark matter candidates or as sources of
the baryon asymmetry through their decay.
