sufficiently regular topology, and if sufficiently many fields exist to allow
us to observe all continuous functions on $X$, then this collection of
continuous functions uniquely determines both the set of points $X$ and the
topology $\tau$ on it. To explore the small-scale structure of spacetime, we
are led to consider the physical fields (the observables) not as classical
(continuous functions) but as quantum operators, and the fundamental observable
as not the collection of all continuous functions but the local algebra of
quantum field operators. In pursuing our approach further, we develop a number
of generalizations of quantum field theory through which it becomes possible to
talk about quantum fields defined on arbitrary topological spaces. Our ultimate
generalization dispenses with the fixed background topological space altogether

spacetime depends in an essential way on the assumption of global
hyperbolicity. Physically, what lie at the foundation of any formalism for
quantization in curved spacetime are the canonical commutation relations,
imposed on the field operators evaluated at a global Cauchy surface. In the
algebraic formulation of linear quantum field theory, the canonical commutation
relations are restated in terms of a well-defined symplectic structure on the
space of smooth solutions, and the local field algebra is constructed as the
Weyl algebra associated to this symplectic vector space. When spacetime is not
globally hyperbolic, e.g. when it contains naked singularities or closed
timelike curves, a global Cauchy surface does not exist, and there is no
obvious way to formulate the canonical commutation relations, hence no obvious
way to construct the field algebra. In a paper submitted elsewhere, we report
on a generalization of the algebraic framework for quantum field theory to
arbitrary topological spaces which do not necessarily have a spacetime metric
defined on them at the outset. Taking this generalization as a starting point,
in this paper we give a prescription for constructing the field algebra of a

constituents, Einstein and Chern--Simons gravity. We use 't Hooft's approach,
formally equivalent to a leading order eikonal approximation: one of the
particles is taken to scatter through the classical spacetime generated by the
other, which is idealized to be lightlike. The required geometries are derived
in all three models; in particular, we thereby provide the first explicit
asymptotically flat solution generated by a localized source in TMG. In
contrast to $D$=4, the metrics are not uniquely specified, at least by naive
asymptotic requirements -- an indeterminacy mirrored in the scattering
amplitudes. The eikonal approach does provide a unique choice, however. We also
discuss the discontinuities that arise upon taking the limits, at the level of
the solutions, from TMG to its constituents, and compare with the analogous
topologically massive vector gauge field models.

invariant equations for the free fields of the open string are discussed. It
had been shown in an earlier paper that this leads to a simple form of the
gauge transformation law. We discuss in some detail some of the curious
features encountered there. The theory looks a little like a massless theory in
one higher dimension that can be dimensionally reduced to give a massive
theory. We discuss the origin of some constraints that are needed for gauge
invariance and also for reducing the set of fields to that of standard string
theory. The mechanism of gauge invariance and the connection with the Virasoro
algebra is a little different from the usual story and is discussed. It is also
shown that these results can be extended in a straightforward manner to closed
strings.

dimensional Dirac spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the
external electromagnetic field is carried out in the gauge which allows to
describe simultaneously particles and antiparticles (massive and massless)
already at the classical level. Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation
is used to obtain canonical (Newton-Wigner) coordinates and in terms of this
variables the theory is quantized. The connection of this quantization with the
deGroot and Suttorp's description of Dirac particle with anomalous magnetic
moment in the external electromagnetic field is discussed.

string theory. It is shown that such interaction can be derived from a
geometrical action principle, with the scalar of curvature of a non-Riemannian,
but {\em metric-compatible}, connection as the lagrangian, and with a
non-parallel volume-element. This action is contrasted with the recently
proposed geometrical action for the 4-dimensional axi-dilaton gravity.

derived in a non-relativistic potential model. The finite-size effects
comprising the surface, curvature and even, the Gauss curvature were
consistently obtained, which shows a converging trend. It is found that there
is a possibility for the formation of metastable strangelets of large mass. The
model predicts low charge to mass ratio as the characteristic signature of
strange matter in agreement with the relativistic studies. This study also
yields an independent estimate for the bag energy density $B$, which is in
agreement with the M.I.T bag model value.
