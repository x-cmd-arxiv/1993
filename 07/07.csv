quark-gluon plasmas that rapidly damps collective color modes. We derive the
characteristic color relaxation time scale, $t_c\approx (3\alpha_s T
\log(m_E/m_M ))^{-1}$, showing its sensitivity to the ratio of the static color
electric and magnetic screening masses. This leads to a surprisingly small
color conductivity, $\sigma_c\approx 2 T/\log(m_E/m_M)$, which in fact vanishes
in the semi-classical (1-loop) limit.

type, which propagates nucleons, pions, deltas and N(1440)-resonances
explicitly in space and time. In particular we examine pion absorption and
inelastic scattering cross sections for pion kinetic energies T(pi) =85-315MeV
and various target masses. In general, the mass-dependence of the experimental
data is well described for energies up to the delta-resonance (\approx 160 MeV)
while the absorption cross sections are somewhat overestimated for the higher
energies. In addition we study the possible dynamical effects of delta- and
pion-potentials in the medium on various observables as well as alternative
models for the in-medium delta-width.
