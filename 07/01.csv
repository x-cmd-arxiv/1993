between the inflaton field and the space-time curvature. We examine two types
of model, where the underlying inflaton potential takes on second-order and
first-order form respectively. One aim is to provide models which satisfy the
solar system constraints on the Brans--Dicke parameter $\omega$. This
constraint has proven very problematic in previous extended inflation models,
and we find circumstances where it can be successfully evaded, though the
constraint must be carefully assessed in our model and can be much stronger
than the usual $\omega > 500$. In the simplest versions of the model, one may
avoid the need to introduce a mass for the Brans--Dicke field in order to
ensure that it takes on the correct value at the present epoch, as seems to be
required in hyperextended inflation. We also briefly discuss aspects of the
formation of topological defects in the inflaton field itself.

all-sky redshift survey of 5313 galaxies extracted from the Infrared

\xi(s) is well described by a power law, $\xi(s) = (s/4.53h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc})^{-1.28}$, on scales \simlt 20\mpc; on larger scales \xi(s) drops below
the extension of this power law. We examine the effect of redshift space
distortions on the correlation function and compute the full two dimensional
correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi). From this, we derive the real space
correlation function, which is well described by $\xi(r) = (r/3.76h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc})^{-1.66}$ on scales \simlt 20\mpc. The derived correlation functions are
found to be consistent with previous determinations in the literature, and seem
to show more power on large scales than predicted by the standard Cold Dark

function of optical galaxies implies an optical to IRAS bias ratio of $b_O/b_I

in a natural way. We calculate the expectation value and probability
distribution of particles at ${\cal J}^+$ for a non-vacuum initial state. The
entropy of the final state is compared to that of a thermal state with the same
energy per mode. We find that the information recovered about the initial state
increases with the number $r$ of the initially incoming particles, reaching for
example over 30\% for $r = 1000$. We point out that recovering information
about the initial state, nevertheless, does not automatically imply the purity
of the final state.

construction of local solutions of the higher-N super self-duality equations

data to produce N=1 solution data, which in turn yields N=2 solution data, and
so on; each stage introducing a dependence of the solution on sufficiently many
additional arbitrary functions to yield the most general supersymmetric
solution having the initial N=0 solution as the helicity +1 component. The
problem of finding the general local solution of the $N>0$ super self-duality
equations therefore reduces to finding the general solution of the usual (N=0)
self-duality equations. Another consequence of the matreoshka phenomenon is the
vanishing of many conserved currents, including the supercurrents, for super

prove that tractability of an $\lmp$ in $\lstd$ is equivalent to tractability
in $\lall$, although the proof is {\it not} constructive. We provide a simple
condition to check tractability in $\lall$. We also address the optimal design
problem for an $\lmp$ by using a relation to the worst case setting. We find
the order of the average case complexity and optimal sample points for
multivariate function approximation. The theoretical results are illustrated
for the folded Wiener sheet measure.
