studying resonant tunneling in semiconductor heterostructures. The method
manifestly takes account of electrons' statistics, which enables to investigate
the influence of the Pauli principle on resonant tunneling in presence of
inelastic scattering. Being applied to evaluation of the resonant current in
semiconductor heterostructures, our approach predicts considerable deviations
from the one-electron picture.

  chain","10 pages + 2 figures available on request; LaTeX version 2.09",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.48.4192",,"cond-mat",,"  The question of the conditions under which 1D systems support extended
electronic eigenstates is addressed in a very general context. Using real space
renormalisation group arguments we discuss the precise criteria for determining
the entire spertrum of extended eigenstates and the corresponding
eigenfunctions in disordered as well as quasiperiodic systems. For purposes of
illustration we calculate a few selected eigenvalues and the corresponding
extended eigenfunctions for the quasiperiodic copper-mean chain. So far, for
the infinite copper-mean chain, only a single energy has been numerically shown
to support an extended eigenstate [ You et al. (1991)] : we show analytically
that there is in fact an infinite number of extended eigenstates in this
lattice which form fragmented minibands.

holonomy of the Christoffel connection or of the spin connection, and its
invariance under the symmetry transformations of the action is showed
(diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations). We then compute the loop
perturbatively, both on a flat background and in the presence of an external
source; we also allow some modifications in the form of the action, and test
the action of ``stabilized'' gravity. A geometrical analysis of the results in
terms of the gauge group of the euclidean theory, $SO(4)$, leads us to the
conclusion that the correspondent statistical system does not develope any
configuration with localized curvature at low temperature. This ``non-local''
behavior of the quantized gravitational field strongly contrasts with that of
usual gauge fields. Our results also provide an explanation for the absence of
any invariant correlation of the curvature in the same approximation.
