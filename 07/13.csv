relation with dispersion in intrinsic magnitudes (after known observational
uncertainties and the effect of cluster depth are removed) of 0.36 and a slope
of 10.2 +/- 0.6. The magnitude dispersion is smaller than found in the Virgo

hint that the Tully-Fisher relation may turn over at the bright end. Adding the
central surface brightness of the disk as a third parameter flattens the slope
of the Tully- Fisher relation and may give a distance estimate with slightly
less dispersion, but the significance of the decrease must be tested on an

approach to quantum mechanics: the emergence of approximate classical
predictability, and the fluctuations about it necessitated by the uncertainty
principle. We consider histories characterized by position samplings at $n$
moments of time. We use this to construct a probability distribution on the
value of (discrete approximations to) the field equations, $F = m \ddot x +
V'(x) $, at $n-2$ times. We find that it is peaked around $F=0$; thus classical
correlations are exhibited. We show that the width of the peak $ \Delta F$ is
largely independent of the initial state and the uncertainty principle takes
the form $2 \sigma^2 \ (\Delta F)^2 \ge { \hbar^2 / t^2 } $, where $\sigma$ is
the width of the position samplings, and $t$ is the timescale between
projections. We determine the modifications to this result when the system is
coupled to a thermal environment. We show that the thermal fluctuations become
comparable with the quantum fluctuations under the same conditions that
decoherence effects come into play. We also study an alternative measure of
classical correlations, namely the conditional probability of finding a
sequence of position samplings, given that particular initial phase space data
have occurred. We use these results to address the issue of the formal
interpretation of the probabilities for sequences of position samplings in the
decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics. The decoherence of the
histories is also briefly discussed.

$(\vec{e},e'p)$ reaction are calculated for medium-heavy nuclei under quasifree
conditions. The formalism presented here incorporates two-body currents related
to meson-exchange and the $\Delta (1232)$ excitation. The final-state
interaction of the outgoing nucleon with the residual nucleus is handled in a
HF-RPA formalism. The sensitivity of the results to the two-body currents is
discussed for the five structure functions in quasielastic $(\vec{e},e'p)$
scattering off the target nuclei $^{16}O$ and $^{40}Ca$. A selective
sensitivity to the two-body currents is obtained in the longitudinal-transverse
interference term $W_{LT}$ where two-body currents can explain part of the
discrepancy between the impulse-approximation calculations and the data.
