used as a probe to the magnetic field structure in the sun. Various cyclic
phenomena occurring on the surface of the sun have been accounted for by the
so-called dynamo-mechanism. According to this, a self-generating mechanism of
solar cyclic activities gives rise to twisting toroidal magnetic fields in the
convective zone. Although its magnitude is not known, the orientation of the
twist is certainly opposite in northern and southern hemispheres of the sun. We
show by numerical calculation that the solar neutrino flux, being sensitive to
the twist, could exhibit observable seasonal oscillation, provided that the
twist is sizable in magnitude and the neutrinos have reasonably large magnetic
moments. This oscillation is ascribed to the fact that the earth's orbit is
slightly inclined to the sun's equator, and that solar neutrinos pass through
the northern (southern) hemisphere of the sun around September (March). We also
argue that similar seasonal oscillation could be exhibited in the azimuthal
asymmetry of recoiling electrons scattered by the solar neutrinos which are
expected to be observed in the super-Kamiokande detector.

freedom on discrete time. The difference equation of motion which maintains a
conserved quantity like energy has a very restricted form that is not probably
derived by the least action principle. On the other hand, the classical
dynamics is possible to be canonically formulated and quantized, if the
equation is derived from an action. The difficulties come mainly from this
incompatibility of the conserved quantity and the action principle. We
formulate a quantum field theory canonically on discrete spacetime in the case
where the field equation is derived from an action, though there may be no
exactly conserved quantity. It may, however, be expected that a conserved
quantity exists for a low ""energy"" region.

in two spatial dimensions. In this paper we study the physical grounds for the
validity of this approximation by considering the Quantum Mechanical scattering
of a charged particle from a two dimensional array of magnetic flux tubes. The
flux tubes are arranged on a regular lattice which is infinitely long in the
``$y$'' direction but which has a (small) finite number of columns in the
``$x$'' direction. Their physical size is assumed to be infinitesimally small.
We develop a method for computing the scattering angle as well as the
reflection and transmission coefficients to lowest order in the Aharonov--Bohm
interaction. The results of our calculation are compared to the scattering of
the same particle from a region of constant magnetic field whose magnitude is
equal to the mean field of all the flux tubes. For an incident plane wave, the
Mean Field approximation is shown to be valid provided the flux in each tube is
much less than a single flux quantum. This is precisely the regime in which
Mean Field Theory for anyons is expected to be valid. When the flux per tube
becomes of order 1, Mean Field Theory is no longer valid.
