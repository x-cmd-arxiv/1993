connection on the cohomology of a $d$-dimensional Calabi-Yau complete
intersection $V$ of $r$ hypersurfaces $V_1, \ldots, V_r$ in a toric variety
${\bf P}_{\Sigma}$ and the system of differential operators annihilating the
special hypergeometric function $\Phi_0$ depending on the fan $\Sigma$. In this
context, the Mirror Symmetry phenomenon can be interpreted as the following
twofold characterization of the series $\Phi_0$. First, $\Phi_0$ is defined by
intersection numbers of rational curves in ${\bf P}_{\Sigma}$ with the
hypersurfaces $V_i$ and their toric degenerations. Second, $\Phi_0$ is the
power expansion near a boundary point of the moduli space of the monodromy
invariant period of the holomorphic differential $d$-form on an another
Calabi-Yau $d$-fold $V'$ which is called Mirror of $V$. Using the generalized
hypergeometric series, we propose a general construction for Mirrors $V'$ of
$V$ and canonical $q$-coordinates on the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals. Because of its importance,
it has been studied through computer experiments as well as in the laboratory
and by analytical means. However, there are important differences between the
way a system composed of many interacting elements is simulated by a digital
machine and the manner in which it behaves when studied in real experiments. In
some instances, these disparities can be marked enough so as to cast doubt on
the implications of cellular automata type simulations for the study of
cooperation in social systems. In particular, if such a simulation imposes
space-time granularity, then its ability to describe the real world may be
compromised. Indeed, we show that the results of digital simulations regarding
territoriality and cooperation differ greatly when time is discrete as opposed
to continuous.

classical strange attractor due to the presence of scale- dependent quantum
effects are studied. Classical quantities such as the Lyapunov exponents and
fractal dimension are examined, and quantum analogs are suggested. These
results are generalized into a framework for quantum dissipative chaos, and
there is a brief discussion of other work in this area.

{entropy} = 1/4 {area of event horizon}, is violated in many interesting cases.
Indeed, several authors have recently conjectured that in general the entropy
of a dirty black hole might be given purely in terms of some surface integral
over the event horizon of that black hole. A formal proof of this conjecture,
using Lorentzian signature techniques, has recently been provided by Wald. This
note performs two functions. Firstly, a rather different proof of this result
is presented --- a proof based on Euclidean signature techniques. The total
entropy is S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + \int_H {S} \sqrt{g} d^2x. The integration
runs over a spacelike cross-section of the event horizon H. The surface entropy
density, {S}, is related to the behaviour of the matter Lagrangian under time
dilations. Secondly, I shall consider the specific case of Einstein-Hilbert
gravity coupled to an effective Lagrangian that is an arbitrary function of the
Riemann tensor (though not of its derivatives). In this case a more explicit
result is obtained S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + 4 pi {k/hbar} \int_H {partial L /
partial R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}} g^\perp_{\mu\lambda} g^\perp_{\nu\rho} \sqrt{g}
d^2x . The symbol $g^\perp_{\mu\nu}$ denotes the projection onto the
two-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the event horizon.
