consequences for cosmology. Three main issues are considered: (i) what makes a
galaxy radio loud?; (ii) what do we know about how the population of radio-loud
galaxies has changed with epoch?; and (iii) what can observations of
high-redshift radio galaxies tell us about general questions of galaxy
formation and evolution? The main conclusion is that radio galaxies are
remarkably ordinary massive ellipticals. The high-redshift examples are
generally old and red and do not make good candidates for primaeval galaxies.

of grand unified physics and also governs whether cosmological events such as
topological defect formation can occur after inflation. The COBE results are
used to limit the energy scale of inflation at around 60 $e$-foldings from the
end of inflation. An exact dynamical treatment based on the Hamilton-Jacobi
equations is then used to translate this into limits on the energy scale at the
end of inflation. General constraints are given, and then tighter constraints
based on physically motivated assumptions regarding the allowed forms of
density perturbation and gravitational wave spectra. These are also compared
with the values of familiar models.

baker's map and their behaviour ranges from chaotic motion on the whole measure
to chaos on a set of measure zero. Thus we have called these maps ``lazy baker
maps.'' The aim of introducing these maps is to provide the simplest models of
systems with a mixed phase space, in which there are both regular and chaotic
motions. We find that despite the obviously contrived nature of these maps they
provide a good model for the study of the quantum mechanics of such systems. We
notice the effect of a classically chaotic fractal set of measure zero on the
corresponding quantum maps, which leads to a transition in the spectral
statistics. Some periodic orbits belonging to this fractal set are seen to scar
several eigenfunctions.

natural family to which the cat maps belong. Thus, a simple propagator
depending on a parameter is constructed which for integer values of the
parameter becomes pathological quantum cat maps, while away from integer values
we find a return to the generic behaviour of non-integrable quantum systems.

critical exponents differ significantly from the pure Ising values. This is in
agreement with other recent Monte Carlo simulations. Our results also support
the identification of the critical behavior of this model with that along the

fluid models separate out into two classes, with $\rho \not= \mu p$ in general
but $\rho = 3p$ in particular and $\rho = p$. It is shown that in both the
cases radial heat flow can be incorporated without disturbing the singularity
free character of the spacetime. Further by introducing massless scalar field
it is possible to open out a narrow window for $\mu, 4 \geq \mu \geq 3$.
