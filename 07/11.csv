rough walls, shear thinning and granular flow. We examine the boundary layers
generated by the roughness of the walls. Shear thinning produces plug flow with
a sharp density contrast at the boundaries. Density waves are spontaneously
generated when the viscosity has a nonlinear dependence on density which
characterizes granular flow.

baryon-pion couplings in the large-N limit of QCD. The symmetry breaking
corrections to the pion-baryon couplings vanish to first order in $1/N$.
Consistency conditions for other couplings, such as the magnetic moments are
also derived.
