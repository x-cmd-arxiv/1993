advecting dynamical flow. If the model is a simple map with constant time
between two iterations, the dynamo rate is the same as the escape rate of
scalar quantties. However, a spread in Poincar\'e section return times lifts
the degeneracy of the vector and scalar advection rates, and leads to dynamo
rates that dominate over the scalar advection rates. For sufficiently large
time spreads we have even found repellers for which the magnetic field grows
exponentially, even though the scalar densities are decaying exponentially.

modified QCD evolution in heavy nuclei. The evolution of small-$x$ gluons is
investigated within the semiclassical approximation. The method of
characteristics is used to evaluate the shadowed distributions in low-$Q$ and
small-$x$ region. In solving the modified evolution equation, we model in
simultaneously fusions from independent constituents and from the same
constituent, both in a proton and in a large loosely bound nucleus of $A\sim
200$. In addition to the actual distributions at small $x$, we study the ratios
of the distributions at an initial scale $Q_0 = 2$ GeV, and show that a strong
nuclear shadowing can follow from the modified QCD evolution.
