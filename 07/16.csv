  The $\lambda$

the framework of the heat kernel method. Radiative corrections are small
compared to the leading sphaleron contribution as long as the Higgs mass is
small compared to the W mass. To 1-loop accuracy, there is no Higgs mass range
compatible with experimental limits where washing-out of a B+L asymmetry could
be avoided for the minimal standard model with one Higgs doublet.
