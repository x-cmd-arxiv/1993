nucleosynthesis, between active and sterile neutrinos, as well as between
active and active neutrinos. We calculate the constraints on mixings between
active and sterile neutrinos from the present observation of the primordial
helium abundance and discuss the potential implications on various
astrophysical and cosmological problems of such oscillations. In particular, we
show that large angle sterile neutrino mixing seems to be excluded as a MSW
solution to the solar neutrino situation or a solution to the atmospheric
neutrino mixing hinted at in some underground experiments. We show how with
this constraint, the next generation of solar neutrino experiments should be
able to determine the resolution of the solar neutrino problem. It is also
shown how sterile neutrinos remain a viable dark matter candidate.

signal due to a weak periodic force in a nonlinear system can be {\it enhanced}
by the addition of external noise - is reviewed. A theoretical approach based
on linear response theory (LRT) is described. It is pointed out that, although
the LRT theory of SR is by definition restricted to the small signal limit, it
possesses substantial advantages in terms of simplicity, generality and
predictive power. The application of LRT to overdamped motion in a bistable
potential, the most commonly studied form of SR, is outlined. Two new forms of
SR, predicted on the basis of LRT and subsequently observed in analogue
electronic experiments, are described.

dimensional CuO$_2$ plane is studied by using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
method in the limit $U_d \to \infty$, where $U_d$ is the Coulomb repulsion
between holes on a Cu site. The VMC results for the energy and the fraction of
$d$-holes are compared with those of the Rice-Ueda type Gutzwiller
approximation (GA). The difference between the VMC and the GA results are most
pronounced at half-filling, and away from half-filling the two results agree
well in both the hole-doped and the electron-doped cases. The doping dependence
of the momentum distribution function is also studied.
