The amplitudes of the scalar and tensor metric perturbations and their
power-spectrum indices, which can in principle be inferred from large-angle CBR
anisotropy experiments and other cosmological data, determine the value of the
inflationary potential and its first two derivatives. From these, the
inflationary potential can be reconstructed in a Taylor series and the
consistency of the inflationary hypothesis tested. A number of examples are
presented, and the effect of observational uncertainties is discussed.

It is
proved that the cosmological density perturbation is associated with a peculiar

theory, which works entirely with quasi-Newtonian fluid flow equations. As an
illustration, the large scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy
(Sachs-Wolfe effect) is calculated without any reference to the metric
perturbation. In addition, assuming the usual adiabatic initial condition on
the density perturbation, we show that the dipole of the anisotropy measures
our peculiar velocity relative to the average peculiar velocity within the last
scattering surface of the microwave background, thus defining its frame of
reference.

allowing for Unruh--Wald buoyancy. We consider a box full of entropy lowered
towards and then dropped into a Reissner--Nordstr\""om black hole in equilibrium
with thermal radiation. We avoid the approximation that the buoyant pressure
varies slowly across the box, and compute the buoyant force exactly. We find,
in agreement with independent investigations, that the neutral point
generically lies very near the horizon. A consequence is that in the generic
case, the Unruh--Wald entropy restriction is neither necessary nor sufficient
for enforcement of the generalized second law. Another consequence is that
generically the buoyancy makes only a negligible contribution to the energy
bookeeping, so that the original entropy bound is recovered if the generalized
second law is assumed to hold. The number of particle species does not figure
in the entropy bound, a point that has caused some perplexity. We demonstrate
by explicit calculation that, for arbitrarily large number of particle species,
the bound is indeed satisfied by cavity thermal radiation in the thermodynamic
regime, provided vacuum energies are included. We also show directly that
thermal radiation in a cavity in $D$ dimensional space also respects the bound
regardless of the value of $D$. As an application of the bound we show that it
strongly restricts the information capacity of the posited black hole remnants,
so that they cannot serve to resolve the information paradox.

nice place for extracting the $D^*D\pi$ coupling constant from the semileptonic
decays of a $\bar{B}$ meson. Two types of weak radiative decays of $\bar{B}$
mesons and bottom baryons are studied. The decay $\Lambda_b^0\to
\Lambda^0\gamma$ receives the electromagnetic penguin $b\to s\gamma$
contribution and has a branching ratio of order $2\times 10^{-5}$. The

Theory (CFT), a VOSA may exhibit a square-zero operator (often, but not always,
the semi-infinite cohomology differential) for which the Virasoro algebra acts
trivially in the cohomology. Capable of shedding its CFT features, such a VOSA
is called a ``topological chiral algebra'' (TCA). We investigate the
semi-infinite cohomology of the vertex operator Weil algebra and indicate a
number of differentials which give rise to TCA structures.

SL(2,R) X U(1) group and on an extended 2d Poincare group. As a consequence,
the constraints become free-field Virasoro generators with background charges.
We argue that the same happens in the non-chiral case. The problem of the
corresponding BRST cohomology is discussed as well as the unitarity of the
theory. One can show that the theory is unitary by chosing a physical gauge,
and hence the problem of transitions from pure into mixed sates is absent.
