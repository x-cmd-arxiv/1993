of close binary systems containing polytropic components. Our method is based
on the use of ellipsoidal trial functions in an energy variational principle.
We consider both synchronized and nonsynchronized systems, constructing the
compressible generalizations of the classical Darwin and Darwin-Riemann
configurations. Our method can be applied to a wide variety of binary models
where the stellar masses, radii, spins, entropies, and polytropic indices are
all allowed to vary over wide ranges and independently for each component. We
find that both secular and dynamical instabilities can develop before a Roche
limit or contact is reached along a sequence of models with decreasing binary
separation. High incompressibility always makes a given binary system more
susceptible to these instabilities, but the dependence on the mass ratio is
more complicated. As simple applications, we construct models of double
degenerate systems and of low-mass main-sequence-star binaries. We also discuss
the orbital evolution of close binary systems under the combined influence of
fluid viscosity and secular angular momentum losses from processes like
gravitational radiation. We show that the existence of global fluid
instabilities can have a profound effect on the terminal evolution of
coalescing binaries. The validity of our analytic solutions is examined by
means of detailed comparisons with the results of recent numerical fluid
calculations in three dimensions.

fluctuations in a perturbed Robertson-Walker spacetime using a new Lagrangian
method based on the velocity gradient and gravity gradient tensors. Borrowing
results from general relativity, we obtain a set of Newtonian ordinary
differential equations for these quantities following a given mass element.
Using these Lagrangian fluid equations we prove the following results: (1) The
spherical tophat perturbation, having zero shear, is the slowest configuration
to collapse for a given initial density and growth rate. (2) Initial density
maxima are not generally the sites where collapse first occurs. (3) Initially
underdense regions may undergo collapse if the shear is not too small. If the
magnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanishes, the nonlinear evolution is described
purely locally by our equations; this condition holds for spherical,
cylindrical, and planar perturbations and may be a good approximation in other
circumstances. Assuming the vanishing of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,
we compute the exact nonlinear gravitational evolution of cold matter. We find
that 56\% of initially underdense regions collapse in an Einstein-de Sitter
universe for a homogeneous and isotropic random field. We also show that, given
this assumption, the final stage of collapse is generically two-dimensional,
leading to strongly prolate filaments rather than Zel'dovich pancakes. While
this result may explain the prevalence of filamentary collapses in N-body
simulations, it is not true in general, suggesting that the magnetic part of
the Weyl tensor need not vanish in the Newtonian limit.

important even if radiation losses, which tend to decelerate the front
propagation, are taken into account. We have also explored the consequences of
the inclusion of shear and bulk viscosity, and we have allowed for saturation
of the kinetic effects. Numerical simulations of a cloud immersed in a hot
medium have been performed; depending on the ratio of conductive to dynamical
time, the density is increased by a huge factor and the cloud may become
optically thick. Clouds that are highly compressed are able to stop the
evaporation process even if their initial size is smaller than the Field
length. In addition to the numerical approach, the time dependent evolution has
been studied also analytically. Simple techniques have been applied to the
problem in order to study the transition stages to a stationary state. The
global properties of the solution for static and steady fronts and useful
relations among the various physical variables are derived; a mechanical
analogy is often used to clarify the physics of the results. It is demonstrated
that a class of soliton-like solutions are admitted by the hydrodynamical
equations appropriate to describe the conduction/cooling fronts (in the
inviscid case) that do not require a heat flux at the boundaries. Some
astrophysical consequences are indicated along with some possible applications

study of their approach to the singularity. The numerical method also naturally
singles out the asymptotically velocity term dominated (AVTD) behavior known to

probably characteristic of a subclass of the rest. The method is first applied
to the unpolarized Gowdy T$^3$ cosmology. Exact pseudo-unpolarized solutions

implementing the constraints is followed. This leads to a set of physical
states, in which however the semi-classical physics of the theory seems to be
completely obscured. As an alternative, we construct a coherent state
formalism, which is the natural framework for understanding the semi-classical
calculations, and argue that it satisfies all necessary requirements of the

infinite set of equations. If this is the case it may be interpreted as a

we find that non-perturbative quantum corrections which are important in strong
coupling regions may completely alter the semiclassical picture, to the extent
that the presumptive space-like boundary becomes time-like, changing in this
way the causal structure of the semiclassical geometry. As a result, only a
small fraction of the total energy is radiated outside the fake event horizon;
most of the energy comes in fact at later retarded times and there is no
