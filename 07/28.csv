hydrogen clouds located in the Galactic halo, immersed in the extragalactic
background radiation field, and supposed to be in pressure equilibrium with the
surrounding (presumably) hot medium. The problem is solved numerically, but an
useful analytical approximation has been derived as well. We discuss the two
main parameters of the problem, \ie the radiation field and the halo pressure,
in the framework of the current models for the halo/disk interaction. We find a
well defined relation between a critical column density at which the cloud
starts to develop a cold central core with the cloud linear size. Making use of
this relation, we suggest a straightforward method to derive the distance to
the cloud. We discuss the possible sources of error in this determination and
it is found that the method is particularly suitable for those clouds which are
subsonic with respect to the surrounding medium, while for the supersonic ones,
the method can only give a lower limit to the distance. The H$\alpha$ emission
from the partially ionized edge of the cloud is calculated and compared with
the available observations; this measure is a powerful indicator of the
possible presence of a shock in the cloud.

conservation constrain the possible temperature jump across the front. If one
assumes that the temperature in the hadronic phase is $T\simeq$ 200 MeV , as
has been suggested by numerous results from relativistic ion collisions, one
can determine the corresponding temperature in the quark phase with the help of
continuity equations across the front. The calculations reveal that the quark
phase must be in a strongly supercooled state. The stability of this solution
with respect to minor modifications is investigated. In particular the effect
of an admixture of hadronic matter in the quark phase (e.g. in the form of
bubbles) is considered in detail. In the absence of admixture the transition
proceeds via a detonation transition and is accompanied by a substantial
super-cooling of the quark-gluon plasma phase. The detonation is accompanied by
less supercooling if a small fraction of bubbles is allowed. By increasing the
fraction of bubbles the supercooling becomes weaker and eventually the
transition proceeds via a smoother deflagration wave.

vortices in two spatial dimensions, when a global \( SO(3) \) symmetry is
spontaneously broken to a discrete group \( \IK \) isomorphic to the group of
integers mod 4. The vortices in this model are characterized by the nonabelian
fundamental group \(\pi_1 (SO(3)/{\IK}) \), which is isomorphic to the group of
quaternions. We present an ansatz describing isolated vortices and prove that
it is stable to perturbations. Kinematic constraints are derived which imply
that at a finite temperature, only two species of vortices are stable to decay,
due to `dissociation'. The latter process is the nonabelian analogue of the
instability of charge \(|q| >1 \) abelian vortices to dissociation into those
with charge \(|q| = 1\). The energy of configurations containing at maximum two
vortex-antivortex pairs, is then computed. When the pairs are all of the same
type, we find the usual Coulombic interaction energy as in the abelian case.
When they are different, one finds novel interactions which are a departure
from Coulomb like behavior. Therefore one can compute the grand canonical
partition function (GCPF) for thermal pair creation of nonabelian vortices, in
the approximation where the fugacities for vortices of each type are small. It
is found that the vortex fugacities depend on a real continuous parameter \(
a\) which characterize the degeneracy of the vacuum. Depending on the relative
sizes of these fugacities, the vortex gas will be dominated by one of either of
the two types mentioned above. In these regimes, we expect the standard
Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions to occur, as in systems of abelian
vortices in 2-dimensions. Between these two regimes, the gas contains pairs of
both types, so nonabelian effects will be important.
