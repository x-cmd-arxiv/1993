probability distribution functions (PDFs) of local variables in nonlinear,
diffusive, dynamical systems including passive scalars advected by chaotic
velocity fields. Intermittent fluctuations on appropriate time scales in the
amplitude of the (chaotic) noise can lead to exponential tails. We provide
numerical evidence for such behavior in deterministic, discrete-time passive
scalar models. Different possibilities for PDFs are also outlined.

fermions is quadratic in the bosons. We obtain a path integral representation
for the generating functional which in real time, in the semiclassical limit,
gives the Landau equation for sound waves and in the imaginary time gives us
the correct form of the specific heat for a Fermi liquid even with the

D49 (1994) 1585-1593","10.1103/PhysRevD.49.1585",,"hep-lat",,"  We consider pure glue QCD at beta=5.7, beta=6.0 and beta=6.3. We evaluate the
gluon propagator both in time at zero 3-momentum and in momentum space. From
the former quantity we obtain evidence for a dynamically generated effective
mass, which at beta=6.0 and beta=6.3 increases with the time separation of the
sources, in agreement with earlier results. The momentum space propagator G(k)
provides further evidence for mass generation. In particular, at beta=6.0, for
k less than 1 GeV, the propagator G(k) can be fit to a continuum formula
proposed by Gribov and others, which contains a mass scale b, presumably
related to the hadronization mass scale. For higher momenta Gribov's model no
longer provides a good fit, as G(k) tends rather to follow an inverse power
law. The results at beta=6.3 are consistent with those at beta=6.0, but only
the high momentum region is accessible on this lattice. We find b in the range
of three to four hundred MeV and the exponent of the inverse power law about
2.7. On the other hand, at beta=5.7 (where we can only study momenta up to 1
GeV) G(k) is best fit to a simple massive boson propagator with mass m. We
argue that such a discrepancy may be related to a lack of scaling for low
momenta at beta=5.7. {}From our results, the study of correlation functions in
momentum space looks promising, especially because the data points in Fourier
space turn out to be much less correlated than in real space.

radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry, namely the minimal $SU(5)$
supergravity model and the class of string-inspired/derived supergravity models
based on the flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ structure supplemented by a minimal set
of additional matter representations such that unification occurs at the string
scale ($\sim10^{18}\GeV$). These models can be fully parametrized in terms of
the top-quark mass, the ratio $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, and three supersymmetry
breaking parameters ($m_{1/2},m_0,A$). The latter are chosen in the minimal
$SU(5)$ model such that the stringent constraints from proton decay and
cosmology are satisfied. In the flipped $SU(5)$ case we consider two
string-inspired supersymmetry breaking scenaria: $SU(N,1)$ no-scale
supergravity and a dilaton-induced supersymmetry breaking scenario. Both imply
universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters: $m_0=A=0$ and
$m_0=\coeff{1}{\sqrt{3}}m_{1/2}, A=-m_{1/2}$ respectively. We present a
comparative study of the sparticle and Higgs spectra of both flipped $SU(5)$
models and the minimal $SU(5)$ model and conclude that all can be partially
probed at the Tevatron and LEPII (and the flipped models at HERA too). In both
flipped $SU(5)$ cases there is a more constrained version which allows to
determine $\tan\beta$ in terms of $m_t,m_{\tilde g}$ and which leads to much
sharper and readily accessible experimental predictions. We also discuss the
prospects for indirect experimental detection: a non-trivial fraction of the
parameter space of the flipped $SU(5)$ models is in conflict with the present
experimental allowed range for the $b\to s\gamma$ rare decay mode, and the
one-loop electroweak radiative corrections imply the 90\% CL upper bound
