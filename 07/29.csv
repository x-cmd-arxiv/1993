effects. It is shown that only with a vector confinement the parameters can be
chosen such as to yield an excellent description of the light pseudoscalar and
vector mesons including weak and two photon decays. However it is found that it
is not possible to reconcile this with the Regge behavior of higher lying meson
states with the same parameter set.
