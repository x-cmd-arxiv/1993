this paper. Such strings were originally proposed as a possible candidate for
the QCD string. Our approach is different from previous ones and is simple and
general enough, with which basic problems can be easily addressed. The Green
function on a surface with Dirichlet boundaries is obtained through the Neumann
Green function on the same surface, by employing a simple approach to Dirichlet
conditions. An easy consequence of the simple calculation of the Green function
is that in the simplest model, namely the bosonic Dirichlet string, the
critical dimension is still 26, and the tachyon is still present in the
spectrum, while the scattering amplitudes differ dramatically from those in the
usual string theory. We discuss the high energy, fixed angle behavior of the
four point scattering amplitudes on the disk and the annulus. We argue for
general power-like behavior of arbitrary high energy, fixed angle scattering
amplitudes. We also discuss the high temperature property of the finite
temperature partition function on an arbitrary surface, and give an explicit
formula of the one on the annulus.

the coupling function $f(\p,\vp)$ in the gauge field kinetic term $f(\p,\vp)
F^2_{\m\n}$, as well as non-perturbative scalar potential $V(\p, \vp)$, e.g.
induced by gaugino condensation in the hidden gauge sector. Stable, finite
energy, electric solutions (corresponding to on abelian subgroup of a
non-abelian gauge group) have the small scale region as the weak coupling
region ($\phi\ra -\infty$) with the modulus $\vp$ slowly varying towards
smaller values. Stable, finite energy, abelian magnetic solutions exist only
for a specific range of threshold correction parameters. At small scales they
correspond to the strong coupling region ($\p\ra \infty$) and the
compactification region ($\vp\ra 0$). The non-perturbative potential $V$ plays
a crucial role at large scales, where it fixes the asymptotic values of $\phi$
and $\vp$ to be at the minimum of $V$.

Nakayashiki to derive an integral formula for the N-point correlation functions

this, we realize the quantum affine symmetry algebra $U_q(su(2)_2)$ of level 2
and its corresponding type I vertex operators in terms of a deformed bosonic
field free of a background charge, and a deformed fermionic field. Up to GSO
type projections, the Fock space is already irreducible and therefore no BRST
projections are involved. This means that no screening charges with their
Jackson integrals are required. Consequently, our N-point correlation functions
are given in terms of usual classical integrals only, just as those derived by
Jimbo et al in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ model through the Frenkel-Jing
bosonization of $U_q(su(2)_1)$.

graphs. We show that the critical temperatures calculated in the DTRS and DQRS
models agree with those deduced from duality arguments in the standard

undergoes a phase transition to a Neel (checkerboard) ordered ground state
which is absent because of frustration in the other cases.

matter system with an anomaly. As an illustration we use induced WZW models,
including a discussion of non--local regularization, the importance of the

become propagating --- one of many roles assigned to them in the BV formalism.
