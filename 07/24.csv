this boundary and show that this functor is representable. We try to dertermine

operator are studied. A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts
that the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations with additional terms of order Mach number squared. We introduce a
fourth-order scheme and compare results with those of the commonly used lattice
Boltzmann discretization and with finite-difference schemes applied to the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive-variable form. We
numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility
and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than
discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown
to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for
the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is
simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a
first-order scheme in time.

experimental bound on the electric charge of the tau neutrino is many orders of
magnitude weaker than that for any other known neutrino. If the tau neutrino
does have a small electric charge, and its mass is greater than 1 MeV, then it
can annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe by electromagnetic
interactions to avoid conflict with the standard cosmology model. A novel
feature of this scenario is that there can be effectively less than three
neutrino species present during nucleosynthesis.
