1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a self-gravitating gas cloud. The
simulation shows that dense cores are produced with a semi-regular interval in
space and time from one edge to the other. At the initial stage the gas near
one of the edges is attracted inwards by gravity and the accumulation of the
gas makes a dense core near the edge. When the dense core grows in mass up to a
certain amount, it gathers gas from the other direction. Accordingly the dense
core becomes isolated from the main cloud and the parent filamentary cloud has
a new edge. This cycle repeats and the fragmentation process propagates towards
the other edge. The propagation speed is a few tens of percent larger than the
sound speed. According to the theory, the age difference for the northwest-most
and southeast-most cores in TMC-1 is estimated to be 0.68~pc/0.6~km~s$^{-1}$ =
$ 10 ^6 $~y. The estimated age difference is consistent with that obtained from

Within this scheme all fermionic supersymmetric particles are naturally light,

doublet may be heavy. This implies both a bound on $\tan\beta < 2.3$, in order
to fulfill the experimental constraints on the chargino masses, and a strong
correlation between $\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z)$ and $\alpha_3(M_Z)$, due to the
suppression of the supersymmetric threshold corrections to the low energy
values of the gauge couplings. Assuming the scalar sparticles to be lighter

210 GeV for $\tan\beta>1$, while the strong gauge coupling values,

persistence length along the string, and $\zeta$, describing the small-scale

been done of this problem. An evolution equation is derived describing how the
distribution develops in time due to the combined effects of the universal
expansion, of intercommuting and loop formation, and of gravitational
radiation. With plausible assumptions about the unknown parameters in the

radiation and small-scale structure effects are neglected, the two dominant
length scales both scale in proportion to the horizon size. When the extra

  Symmetry of the Massless Thirring Model","7 pages. LaTeX. UT-Komaba 93-11","Phys.Lett. B313 (1993) 103-107","10.1016/0370-2693(93)91197-U",,"hep-th",,"  Using the hamiltonian formalism, we investigate the smooth bosonization
method in which bosonization and fermionization are carried out through a
specific gauge-fixing of an enlarged gauge invariant theory. The generator of
the local gauge symmetry, which cannot be derived from the lagrangian of the
enlarged theory, is obtained by making a canonical transformation. We also show
that the massless Thirring model possesses a similar local gauge symmetry for a
speific value of the coupling constant.

stationary open string in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. The
equations of motion for the perturbations in the 2 transverse physical
directions are solved to second order in a weak field expansion. We then set up
a scattering formalism where an ingoing wave is partly transmitted and partly
reflected due to the interaction with the gravitational field of the black
hole. We finally calculate the reflection coefficient to third order in our
weak field expansion.

cases n=1,2,3, in a new way. Starting from the Poisson-bracket realization we
derive a set of partial differential equations for the generators as functions
of classical canonical variables. We obtain a solution to these equations that
represents the classical limit of a boson mapping of the algebra. The
relationship to the collective dynamics is formulated as a theorem that
associates the mapping with an exact solution of the time-dependent Hartree
approximation. This solution determines a decoupled classical symplectic
manifold, thus satisfying the criteria that define an exactly solvable model in
the theory of large amplitude collective motion. The models thus obtained also
provide a test of methods for constructing an approximately decoupled manifold
in fully realistic cases. We show that an algorithm developed in one of our
earlier works reproduces the main results of the theorem.

to probes of the nucleon's strangeness content. Connections are drawn between
such studies and tests of electroweak gauge theory using electron or neutrino
scattering. Outstanding theoretical issues in the interpretation of
semileptonic neutral current measurements are highlighted, and the prospects
for undertaking neutrino and parity-violating electron scattering experiments
in the near future are surveyed.
