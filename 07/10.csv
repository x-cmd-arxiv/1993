(""K41"") scaling $\zeta_m=m/3$ of the $m^{th}$ moments of the velocity
differences in high Reynolds number turbulence are calculated, extending a
method to approximately solve the Navier-Stokes equation described earlier. We
suggest to introduce the notion of scale resolved intermittency corrections
$\delta\zeta_m(p)$, because we find that these $\delta\zeta_m(p)$ are large in
the viscous subrange, moderate in the nonuniversal stirring subrange but,
surprisingly, extremely small if not zero in the inertial subrange. If ISR
intermittency corrections persisted in experiment up to the large Reynolds
number limit, our calculation would show, that this could be due to the opening
of phase space for larger wave vectors. In the higher order velocity moment
$\langle|u(p)|^m\rangle$ the crossover between inertial and viscous subrange is
$(10\eta m/2)^{-1}$, thus the inertial subrange is {\it smaller} for higher
moments.

  for open systems","5 pages (REVTEX), NSB-1",,,,"cond-mat",,"  Linear response theory for open (infinite) systems leads to an expression for
the current response which contains surface terms in addition to the usual bulk
Kubo term. We show that this surface term vanishes identically if the correct
order of limits is maintained in the derivation: the system size, L, must be
taken to infinity before the adiabatic turn-on rate $\delta$ of the
perturbation is taken to zero. In contrast to recent claims this shows that
linear response theory for open systems is gauge-invariant without modification
of the continuity equation. We show that a simpler derivation of the
Landauer-B\""uttiker equations may be obtained consistently from the bulk Kubo
term, noting that surface terms arising here are non-vanishing because they
involve the opposite order of limits, $\delta \to 0$, then $L \to \infty$.
