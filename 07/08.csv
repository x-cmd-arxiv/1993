required to reconcile the results of the chlorine and the Kamiokande solar
neutrino experiments. None of the 1000 solar models in a full Monte Carlo
simulation is consistent with the results of the chlorine or the Kamiokande
experiments. Even if the solar models are forced articficially to have a ${}^8
B$ neutrino flux in agreement with the Kamiokande experiment, none of the
fudged models agrees with the chlorine observations. This comparison shows that
consistency of the chlorine and Kamiokande experiments requires some physical
process that changes the shape of the ${}^8 B$ neutrino energy spectrum. The
GALLEX and SAGE experiments, which currently have large statistical
uncertainties, differ from the predictions of the standard solar model by $2
\sigma$ and $3 \sigma$, respectively. The possibility that the neutrino
experiments are incorrect is briefly discussed.

within the Renormalization Group framework. A brief introduction to $\phi^4$
theory in four dimensions and the path integral formulation for fermions is
given. The strategy is as follows. First, the modes on either side of the Fermi
surface within a cut-off $\Lambda$ are chosen and a path integral is written to
describe them. An RG transformation which eliminates a part of these modes, but
preserves the action of the noninteracting system is identified. Finally the
possible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as
relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A $d=1$ warmup calculation involving a system
of fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, the RG correctly
yields a scale invariant system (Luttinger liquid) In $d=2$ and 3, for
rotationally invariant Fermi surfaces, {\em automatically} leads to Landau's
Fermi liquid theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an
effective mass and a Landau function $F$, with the only relevant perturbations
being of the superconducting (BCS) type The functional flow equations for the
BCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of flows, one
for each angular momentum. It is shown that similar results hold for
rotationally non-invariant (but time-reversal invariant) Fermi surfaces also, A
study of a nested Fermi surface shows an additional relevant flow leading to
charge density wave formation. For small $\Lambda / K_F$, a 1/N expansion
emerges, with $N = K_F/ \Lambda$, which explains why one is able to solve the
narrow cut-off theory. The search for non-Fermi liquids in $d=2$

compared them with the measured values and found good agreement. In the limit
of zero momentum transfer, we find scattering matrix elements in agreement with
previous estimates for \si29 but significantly different than previous work for
\ge73. A modest quenching, in accord with shell model studies of other heavy
nuclei, has been included to bring agreement between the measured and
calculated values of the magnetic moment for \ge73. Even with this quenching,
the calculated scattering rate is roughly a factor of 2 higher than the best
previous estimates; without quenching, the rate is a factor of 4 higher. This
implies a higher sensitivity for germanium dark matter detectors. We also
investigate the role of finite momentum transfer upon the scattering response
for both nuclei and find that this can significantly change the expected rates.

Heun's differential equation and using this relation Carlitz was the first to
get exact closed forms for some Heun functions. Similarly the associated
Stieltjes-Carlitz polynomials lead to a new differential equation which we call
associated Heun. Thanks to the link with orthogonal polynomials we are able to
deduce two integral relations connecting associated Heun functions with
different parameters and to exhibit the set of associated Heun functions which
generalize Carlitz's. Part of these results were used by the author to derive
the Stieltjes transform of the measure of orthogonality for the associated
Stieltjes-Carlitz polynomials using asymptotic analysis; here we present a new
derivation of this result.

solved self-consistently in an approximation that goes beyond the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The traditional approach consists in solving the nucleon
Schwinger-Dyson equation with bare meson propagators and bare meson-nucleon
vertices; the corrections to the meson propagators are calculated using the
bare nucleon propagator and bare nucleon-meson vertices. It is known that such
an approximation scheme produces the appearance of ghost poles in the
propagators. In this paper the coupled system of Schwinger-Dyson equations for
the nucleon and the meson propagators are solved self-consistently including
vertex corrections. The interplay of self-consistency and vertex corrections on
the ghosts problem is investigated. It is found that the self-consistency does
not affect significantly the spectral properties of the propagators. In
particular, it does not affect the appearance of the ghost poles in the
propagators.
