$S_3$ to the UCSB SP91 experiment and find that the mean of the four frequency
channels is by this criterion strongly non-gaussian. Such an observation would
be highly unlikely in a gaussian theory with a small coherence angle, such as
standard ($n=1$, $\Omega_b = .05$, $h = .5$) inflation. We cannot conclude that
the non-gaussianity is cosmological in origin, but if we assume it due instead
to foreground contamination or instrumental effects, and remove the points
which are clearly responsible for the non-gaussian behavior, the rms of the
remaining fluctuations is too small for consistency with standard inflation.
Further data are needed before definitive conclusions may be drawn. Finally, we
generalize the ideas behind this statistic to other types of non-gaussian
behavior that might be detected in other experimental schemes.

search for chiral condensates or for point-like structure of the Pomeron), but
because it dictates the structure of the backgrounds and underlying events in

construction of modular invariant partition functions for conformal field
theories built by tensoring together other conformal field theories. First we
show how the possible modular invariants for the tensor product theory are
constrained if the allowed modular invariants of the individual conformal field
theory factors have been classified. We illustrate the use of these constraints
for theories of the type $SU(2)_{K_A}xSU(2)_{K_B}$, finding all consistent
