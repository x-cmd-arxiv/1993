the heat inputs to the neutral gas in low pressure environments, such as in
outer disks of spiral galaxies, in galactic halos or in intergalactic space.
For a range of model parameters we calculate the gas kinetic and spin
temperatures ($T_K$ and $T_S$) and the relation between $T_S$ and the heat
input to the gas. We outline the conditions for a ``two phase medium'' to
exist. We find that although $T_S$ can be much smaller than $T_K$, $T_S$ is
always $ \gg 3$ K for column densities greater that $5 \times 10^{18}$
cm$^{-2}$. This excludes the possibility that relevant HI masses at the
periphery of galaxies are invisible at 21-cm in emission. The outermost
interstellar gas in a disk galaxy is more directly affected by external
processes and in this paper we estimate the intensity of the extragalactic
background at energies close to 0.1 keV by comparing our theoretical results
with HI emission/absorption studies. We take into account the possibility that
some energy produced in the inner regions affects the energy balance in outer
regions. We find that in the absence of any other local heat source QSO
dominated background models are still compatible with the spin temperature
limits derived for the two best documented HI emission/absorption studies in
outer regions.

the surface density of neutral hydrogen when this approaches the value of $\sim
2\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this paper we model these HI edges as places
where the ratio of neutral to ionized hydrogen drops rapidly due to ionizing
radiation. We use two different models for the vertical distribution of gas
above the outer galactic plane: in the first model we derive the density from
the ideal gas law while in the second model we insert a macroscopic pressure
term and derive the density as for an isothermal slab. We consider two
different sources of ionizing photons: external fluxes of different intensity
and spectral index due to quasars, and a monochromatic UV flux due to neutrino
decays. We find that galaxies which have a smaller gas scale height should show
outer HI disks to a lower column density and smoother HI edges. The sharpness
of the HI-HII transition and the total column density at which the medium is
50$\%$ ionized, are strongly correlated. We present several model fits to the
HI sharp edge observed in M33. If today's UV background is dominated by
attenuated quasar light, which gives $\sim 10^{-14}$ H ionizations s$^{-1}$, a
large gas scale height or equivalently a nearly spherical halo is preferred. If
ionizing photons from decaying neutrinos are responsible for the sharp edge, a
flat dark matter halo, is required.

seen on the CO J=3-2 lines toward W3 IRS 5, GL 490, NGC 2071, W28 A2, GL 2591,

  The results of our survey suggest that EHV wings are common around infrared
sources of moderate to high luminosity (500 to 4x10^5 Lsun) in dense regions.
Line ratios imply that the EHV gas is usually optically thin and warm.
Characteristic velocities range from 20 to 40 km/s, yielding timescales of
1600-4200 yr. Since most sources in this study are producing some ionizing
photons, these short timescales suggest that neutral winds coexist with
ionizing photons.
  We examined two possible sources for the EHV CO emission: a neutral stellar
wind; and swept-up or entrained molecular gas. Neither can be ruled out. If the
high-velocity (HV) gas is swept up by a momentum-conserving stellar wind traced
by the extremely high velocity CO emission, most of the C in the winds from
luminous objects cannot be in CO. If the EHV and HV forces are equal, the
fraction of C in a form other than CO increases with source luminosity and with
the production rate of ionizing photons.
