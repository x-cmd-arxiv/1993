continuum HST images of DG~Tau. The restored [O~I] and H$\alpha$ images show
that DG~Tau has a jet with a projected length of 25~AU and width $\leq$10~AU,
and is already collimated at a projected distance of $\sim$~40~AU (0\farcs25)
from the star. Such a narrow width and short collimation distance for a stellar
jet places important constraints on theoretical models of jet formation.

  electron gas","33 pages, TeX, Version 3.1, S.I.S.S.A. preprint 35/93/CM",,"10.1007/BF01320503",,"cond-mat",,"  We have considered the processes which lead to elastic scattering between two
far ultraviolet or X--ray photons while they propagate inside a solid, modeled
as a simple electron gas. The new ingredient, with respect to the standard
theory of photon--photon scattering in vacuum, is the presence of low--energy,
nonrelativistic electron--hole excitations. Owing to the existence of
two--photon vertices, the scattering processes in the metal are predominantly
of second order, as opposed to fourth order for the vacuum case. The main
processes in second order are dominated by exchange of virtual plasmons between
the two photons. For two photons of similar energy $\hbar \Omega$, this gives
rise to a cross section rising like $\Omega^2$ up to maximum of around
$10^{-32}$~cm$^2$, and then decreasing like $\Omega^{-6}$. The maximal cross
section is found for the photon wavevector $k \sim k_{F}$, the Fermi surface
size, which typically means a photon energy $\hbar \Omega$ in the keV range.
Possible experiments aimed at checking the existence of these rare but
seemingly measurable elastic photon--photon scattering processes are discussed,
using in particular intense synchrotron sources.

Simple 2D
short-range lattice model hamiltonians are constructed, keeping in mind the
phenomenology of real perovskite systems, like $SrTiO_{3}$ and $KTaO_{3}$.
Pertinent quantum tunneling phenomena, and the presence of an ice-like
constraint are demonstrated. The two simplest models, namely a plain quantum
four-state clock model, and a constrained one, are then studied in some detail.
We show the equivalence of the former, but not of the latter, to a quantum
Ising model. For the latter, we describe a very good analytical wavefunction
valid in the special case of zero coupling ($J = 0$). In order to study the
full quantum statistical mechanics of both models, a Path Integral Monte Carlo
calculation is set up, and implemented with a technique, which even in the
constrained case permits a good convergence for increasing time slice number
$m$. The method is applied first to the unconstrained model, which serves as a
check, and successively to the constrained quantum four-state clock model. It
is found that in both cases, a quantum phase transition still takes place at
finite coupling J, between a ferroelectric and a quantum paraelectric state,
even when the constraint hinders disordering of the ferroelectric state. This
model paraelectric state has a finite excitation gap, and no broken symmetry.
The possible role of additional (""oxygen hopping"") kinetic terms in making
closer contact with the known phenomenology of $SrTiO_{3}$ is discussed.

  Cardiovascular Electrophysiology, 1993",,,,"patt-sol nlin.PS q-bio",,"  As an objective measurement of spatial order in ventricular fibrillation
(VF), spatial correlation functions and their characteristic lengths were
estimated from epicardial electrograms of pigs in VF. The correlation length of
the VF in pigs was found to be approximately 4-10 mm, varying as fibrillation
progressed. The degree of correlation decreased in the first 4 seconds after
fibrillation then increased over the next minute. The correlation length is
much smaller than the scale of the heart, suggesting that many independent
regions of activity exist on the epicardium at any one time. On the other hand,
the correlation length is 4 to 10 times the interelectrode spacing, indicating
that some coherence is present. These results imply that the heart behaves
during VF as a high-dimensional, but not random, system involving many spatial
degrees of freedom, which may explain the lack of convergence of fractal
dimension estimates reported in the literature. Changes in the correlation
length also suggest that VF reorganizes slightly in the first minute after an
initial breakdown in structure.
