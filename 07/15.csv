over conifolds in the formulation of Euclidean sums over histories for gravity.
The first step in precisely formulating any sum over topological spaces is that
one must have an algorithmically implementable method of generating a list of
all spaces in the set to be summed over. This requirement causes well known
problems in the formulation of sums over manifolds in four or more dimensions;
there is no algorithmic method of determining whether or not a topological
space is an n-manifold in five or more dimensions and the issue of whether or
not such an algorithm exists is open in four. However, as this paper shows,
conifolds are algorithmically decidable in four dimensions. Thus the set of
4-conifolds provides a starting point for a concrete implementation of
Euclidean sums over histories in four dimensions. Explicit algorithms for
summing over various sets of 4-conifolds are presented in the context of Regge
calculus. Postscript figures available via anonymous ftp at

formalism to the rotational nuclei $^{155,157}$Gd, where recent experimental
data requires an explanation. We find no clear evidence of a need for Coriolis
attenuation.

iso-spin dependent part of the spin-orbit potential.

product ansatz. The energy is expanded in a set of rotationally invariant
quadratic functions of translational and iso-rotational velocities in the
product ansatz and all inertial parameters are evaluated. Most of the iso-spin
dependent parameters are small at separations larger than 1 fm. However, some
parameters of the coupling between the iso-rotational velocities of the
Skyrmions decay slowly, as $1/R$, when zero pion mass is used. Otherwise we
find that the results are not sensitive to the addition of the pion mass term.

in the 1s-0d configuration space. The Hamiltonian was chosen to have isovector
pairing and isoscalar multipole-multipole interactions, and the calculations
were performed within the fixed-particle, canonical ensemble. The results
demonstrate the feasibility of the method for $N\neq Z$ even-even and odd-odd
N=Z nuclei. In particular, static observables for even-even Ne isotopes and
Na-22 compare well with results obtained from exact diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian. Response functions are presented for Ne-22 and compared with exact
results, and the viability of cranked calculations for $N\neq Z$ even-even
nuclei is addressed. We present methods for computing observables in the
canonical ensemble using Fourier extraction, and for determining the nuclear
shape.
