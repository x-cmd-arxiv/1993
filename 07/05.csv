low-redshift Lya absorption in the sight-line to the quasar 3C273. Narrow-band
filter observations show that there are no H II regions within a 12 kpc radius
of the line-of-sight to the quasar, at the velocities of three of the
absorbers. Broad-band imaging shows that there are no dwarf galaxies at Virgo
distances with absolute magnitude above MB~-13.5 and within a radius of 40 kpc.
We present fiber spectroscopy of galaxies within a radius of 1 deg, down to an
apparent magnitude of B~19. We show that the absorbers are definitely not
distributed at random with respect to the galaxies, but also that the
absorber-galaxy correlation function is not as strong as the galaxy-galaxy
correlation function on large scales. Our data are consistent with the
hypothesis that all galaxies more luminous than 1/10 L* have effective
cross-sections (for association with absorbers with Log(NH)>13.0), of between
0.5 and 1 Mpc. We also show a clear case of a Lya absorber which has no galaxy
brighter than MB=-18 within a projected distance of 4.8 Mpc, and discuss the
possibility that Lya absorbers are destroyed in a rich galaxy environment.

  appended",,"10.1086/174000",,"astro-ph",,"  We have examined the effect of the environmental density on the arm
classification of an extensive sample of spiral galaxies included in the Nearby
Galaxy Catalog (Tully, 1988a). We have also explored the dependence of the arm
class of a galaxy on other factors, such as its blue absolute magnitude and its
disk-to-total mass ratio, inferred in the literature either from the gradient
of a good galaxy rotation curve or from a photometric mass decomposition
method. We have found that the arm class is strongly related to the absolute
magnitude in the mid-type spirals (in the sense that grand design galaxies are,
on average, more luminous than flocculent objects), whilst this relation is
considerably weaker in the early and late types. In general the influence of
the local density on the arm structure appears to be much weaker than that of
the absolute magnitude. The local density acts essentially in strengthening the
arm class--absolute magnitude relation for the mid types, whereas no
environmental density effects are observed in the early and late types. Using
the most recent estimates of the disk-to-total mass ratio, we do not confirm
this ratio to be a significant factor which affects the arm class;
nevertheless, owing to poor statistics and large uncertanties, the issue
remains open. Neither a local density effect nor an unambiguous bar effect on
the disk-to-total mass ratio is detectable; the latter finding may challenge
some theoretical viewpoints on the formation of bar structures.

because of the alignment of such a strong radio emitter behind the outer H\I
disk of a relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy. This provides an opportunity to
study the spin-temperature characteristics of atomic hydrogen at low column
densities, in an apparently star-free environment. We previously reported a
tentative detection of absorption against the quasar based on VLA C--array
observations; we have now made more sensitive maps of the H\I emission from
\NGC4651 with the VLA D--array, and we have attempted to confirm the weak H\I
absorption against the quasar at higher spatial and spectral resolution in VLA
B--array. The possible absorption feature against this quasar appears to be
weaker than we previously suspected, even though it seems fairly clear that H\I
emission is present close to the line of sight to the quasar.The weakness of
the possible absorption seems also to confirm, conversely, the trend found in
previous observations that where strong absorption lines are seen, the galaxies
show evidence of disturbance. The possible detection of (or limits on)
absorption suggest that the neutral gas in the outer disk is quite warm. We use
the absorption and emission measurements to set lower limits on the combination
of heating inputs outside the star-forming regions of a disk galaxy and/or the
intensity of the cosmic background radiation around 100 eV.

wavelength, the electronic levels within a vortex core are quantized, and
separated by energies of the order of the superconducting gap. The absence of a
continuum modifies significantly the energy dissipation due to the motion of
vortices. At zero temperature, dissipation is suppressed, and the system shows
non ohmic behavior. The I-V characteristics show two distinct regimes. Below a
given electric field, I is strongly dependent on V. Flux flow resistivity also
shows a marked dependence on temperature, and reaches conventional values near
$T_c$.
