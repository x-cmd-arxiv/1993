distribution should exhibit a dipole in the direction of the solar motion
relative to the cosmic microwave background. This is due to the combined
effects of abberation, an anisotropic shift of the burst event rate, and an
angular variation in the distance out to which bursts can be detected.
  We derive the amplitude of the expected dipole for an open and flat
cosmological model, and for various possible evolution rates of the burst
population. Although our dimensionless velocity with respect to the CMB rest
frame is of order $10^{-3}$, the dipole amplitude is of order $10^{-2}$, an
order of magnitude larger. The results depend very weakly on the value of
$\Omega_0$, but are sensitive to the spectral index of the bursts' photon
spectra, and to the rate of evolution of the burst population. There is no
dependence on the value of the Hubble constant.
  A clear detection of the dipole will require a larger sample of bursts than
currently available (of order $10^4$). Future statistical analyses of the
hypothesis that bursts originate at cosmological distances should take this
effect into account, rather than assuming a perfectly isotropic distribution,
for obtaining the correct statistical significance of their results.

equations) a Noether charge $(n-2)$-form, ${\bf Q}$. Assuming only that the
theory admits stationary black hole solutions with a bifurcate Killing horizon,
and that the canonical mass and angular momentum of solutions are well defined
at infinity, we show that the first law of black hole mechanics always holds
for perturbations to nearby stationary black hole solutions. The quantity
playing the role of black hole entropy in this formula is simply $2 \pi$ times
the integral over $\Sigma$ of the Noether charge $(n-2)$-form associated with
the horizon Killing field, normalized so as to have unit surface gravity.
Furthermore, we show that this black hole entropy always is given by a local
geometrical expression on the horizon of the black hole. We thereby obtain a
natural candidate for the entropy of a dynamical black hole in a general theory
of gravity. Our results show that the validity of the ``second law"" of black
hole mechanics in dynamical evolution from an initially stationary black hole

Poisson brackets of quasi-primary fields. In the case of the $\W_\S^\G$-algebra
constructed through the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction based on an arbitrary
$sl(2)$ subalgebra $\S$ of a simple Lie algebra $\G$, we exhibit a natural
isomorphism between this finite Lie algebra and $\G$ whereby the M\""obius
$sl(2)$ is identified with $\S$.

  Particle creation can occur because of the time-dependence of these
background fields. In gauge theories, there is a unphysical sector and
consequently unphysical particles may be produced. However, it is shown that
produced unphysical particles have no contribution to backreaction to
background fields.
