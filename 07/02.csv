gradually becomes faster and faster, or by a first-order phase transition. We
describe a model where inflation ends in a different way, due to a very rapid
rolling (`waterfall') of a scalar field $\sigma$ triggered by another scalar
field $\phi$. This model looks as a hybrid of chaotic inflation and the usual
theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Another hybrid model to be discussed
here uses some building blocks from extended inflation (Brans-Dicke theory),
from new inflation (phase transition due to a non-minimal coupling of the
inflaton field to gravity) and from chaotic inflation (the possibility of
inflation beginning at large as well as at small $\sigma$). In the simplest
version of this scenario inflation ends up by slow rolling, thus avoiding the
big-bubble problem of extended inflation.

massive particles coupled to gravity in a covariant and nonminimal way, namely
one real tensor and one complex vector. The gauge is fixed by means of the
unusual gauge-fixing that gives the same effective action as in the context of
the background field method. Indeed, with the background field method it is
simple to see that the regularization effectively works. On the other hand, we
show that in the usual formalism (non background) the regularization cannot
work with each gauge-fixing.In particular, it does not work with the usual one.
Moreover, we show that, under a suitable choice of the Pauli-Villars
coefficients, the terms divergent in the Pauli-Villars masses can be corrected
by the Pauli-Villars fields themselves. In dimension four, there is no need to
add counterterms quadratic in the curvature tensor to the Einstein action
(which would be equivalent to the introduction of new coupling constants). The
technique also works when matter is coupled to gravity. We discuss the possible
consequences of this approach, in particular the renormalization of Newton's
coupling constant and the appearance of two parameters in the effective action,

dimensional field theory endowed with extended conformal symmetry is given,
which is based on deformation theory of holomorphic and Hermitian spaces. The
geometric background consists of a vector bundle $E$ over a closed surface
$\Sigma$ endowed with a holomorphic structure and a Hermitian structure
subordinated to it. The symmetry group is the semidirect product of the
automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(E)$ of $E$ and the extended Weyl group ${\rm
Weyl}(E)$ of $E$ and acts on the holomorphic and Hermitian structures. The
extended Weyl anomaly can be shifted into an automorphism chirally split
anomaly by adding to the action a local counterterm, as in ordinary conformal
field theory. The dependence on the scale of the metric on the fiber of $E$ is
encoded in the Donaldson action, a vector bundle generalization of the
Liouville action. The Weyl and automorphism anomaly split into two
contributions corresponding respectively to the determinant and
projectivization of $E$. The determinant part induces an effective ordinary
Weyl or diffeomorphism anomaly and the induced central charge can be computed.

Gamow-Teller strength functions are systematically calculated and reproduce the
data to within the standard quenching factor. Their fine structure indicates
that fragmentation makes much strength unobservable. As a by-product, the
calculations suggest a microscopic description of the onset of rotational
motion. The spectroscopic quality of the results provides strong arguments in
favour of the general validity of monopole corrected realistic forces, which is

exchange ($\rho, \sigma, \omega$) and intermediate $\Delta$ creation with $\pi$

the $\rho$ meson is found not to be discardable in a theoretical description of
the ($\gamma$,pn) reaction. The incorporation of an energy dependence and a
decay width in the $\Delta$ propagator is observed to be essential in order to
arrive at a more realistic description of ($\gamma$,NN) reactions at higher

spectral function in $^{16}{\rm O}$ is studied as a function of energy. This
influence, which is represented by the admixture of high-momentum components,
is found to be small in the $p$-shell quasihole wave functions. It is therefore
unlikely that studies of quasihole momentum distributions using the $(e,e'p)$
reaction will reveal a significant contribution of high momentum components.
Instead, high-momentum components become increasingly more dominant at higher
excitation energy. The above observations are consistent with the energy
distribution of high-momentum components in nuclear matter.
