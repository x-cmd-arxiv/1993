SU-PHYS-93-443-3752",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.48.8336",,"cond-mat",,"  The growth and ordering of a Pb layer deposited on Cu(001) at 150 K has been
studied using atom beam scattering. At low coverage, ordered Pb islands with a
large square unit cell and nearly hexagonal internal structure are formed. This
is a high order commensurate phase with 30 atoms in the unit cell. From the
measurement of the island diffraction peak profiles we find a power law for the
mean island - size versus coverage with an exponent $n=0.54 \pm 0.03$. A
scaling behavior of growth is confirmed and a simple model describing island
growth is presented. Due to the high degeneracy of the monolayer phase,
different islands do not diffract coherently. Therefore, when islands merge
they still diffract as separate islands and coalescence effects are thus
negligible. From the result for $n$ we conclude that the island density is
approximately a constant in the coverage range $0.1 < \Theta < 0.5$ where the
ordered islands are observed. We thus conclude that most islands nucleate at
$\Theta < 0.1$ and then grow in an approximately self similar fashion as
$\Theta$ increases.

conflict with certain large-N predictions. According to both large-N and
lattice strong-coupling arguments, the perimeter law behavior of adjoint Wilson
loops at large scales is due to charge-screening, and is suppressed relative to
the area term by a factor of $1/N^2$. In the abelian projection theory,
however, the perimeter law is due to the fact that $N-1$ out of $N^2-1$ adjoint
quark degrees of freedom are (abelian) neutral and unconfined; the suppression
factor relative to the area law is thus only $1/N$. We study numerically the
behavior of Wilson loops and Polyakov lines with insertions of (abelian) charge
projection operators, in maximal abelian gauge. It appears from our data that
the forces between abelian charged, and abelian neutral adjoint quarks are not
significantly different. We also show via the lattice strong-coupling expansion
that, at least at strong couplings, QCD flux tubes attract one another, whereas
vortices in type II superconductors repel.

almost exact analogy: 1) The Lagrangian for these states is associated with a
certain 2d generalization of the KM group. It describes a coadjoint orbit of
this group as a Kirillov symplectic manifold and also the corresponding group
representation. 2) It can be obtained from with a ``self-dual"" or
``anti-self-dual"" sector of a Lagrangian describing a massless scalar and a
Maxwell field [ the phrase ``self-dual"" here being used essentially in its
sense in monopole theory]. There are similar results for the nonabelian $BF$

the edge Lagrangians for $BF$ systems are certain natural generalizations of
field theory Lagrangians related to KM groups.

dimensional representations of $ U_q SL(2)$ are identical, up to overall
normalisation, to the modular S matrix of Kac and Wakimoto for rational $k$

modular Hopf algebras, for any root of unity $q=e^{-i\pi m/r}$, obtained by
taking appropriate quotients of $U_q SL(2)$, that give rise to 3-manifold
invariants according to the approach of Reshetikin and Turaev. The phase factor
correcting for the `framing anomaly' in these invariants is equal to $ e^{- {{i
\pi} \over 4} ({ {3k} \over {k+2}})}$, an analytic continuation of the anomaly
at integer $k$. As expected, the Verlinde formula gives fusion rule
multiplicities in agreement with the modular Hopf algebras. This leads to a
proposal, for $(k+2)=r/m$ rational with an odd denominator, for a set of
$\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations obtained by dropping some of the highest
weight representations in the Kac-Wakimoto set and replacing them with lowest
weight representations. For this set of representations the Verlinde formula
gives non-negative integer fusion rule multiplicities. We discuss the
consistency of the truncation to highest and lowest weight representations in
