quantum dots in the limit of very strong magnetic fields where the electron
system is completely spin-polarized and all electrons are in the lowest Landau
level. Without electron-electron interactions the ground state is a single
Slater determinant corresponding to a droplet centered on the minimum of the
confinement potential and occupying the minimum area allowed by the Pauli
exclusion principle. Electron-electron interactions favor droplets of larger
area. We derive exact criteria for the stability of the maximum density droplet
against edge excitations and against the introduction of holes in the interior
of the droplet. The possibility of obtaining exact results in the strong
magnetic field is related to important simplifications associated with broken
time-reversal symmetry in a strong magnetic field.

annihilating the finite-dimensional invariant subspace. In low dimensions a
classification is given by algebras $sl_2({\bold R})$ (for differential

breaking part of the QCD effective Lagrangian that includes into each order
additional terms which in the standard chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT)
are relegated to higher orders. The new expansion represents a systematic and
unambiguous generalization of the standard $\chi$PT, and is more likely to
converge rapidly. It provides a consistent framework for a measurement of the
importance of additional ``higher order'' terms whose smallness is usually
assumed but has never been checked. A method of measuring, among other
quantities, the QCD parameters $\hat{m}\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ and the quark
mass ratio $m_s/\hat{m}$ is elaborated in detail. The method is illustrated
using various sets of available data. Both of these parameters might be
considerably smaller than their respective leading order standard $\chi$PT
values. The importance of new, more accurate, experimental information on
low-energy $\pi-\pi$ scattering is stressed.

these linkings become homotopically nontrivial and can be studied by
investigating the topology of the corresponding configuration spaces. Our
analysis reveals the existence of topological terms which give the linking
number of the world-tubes of distinct species of ball solitons in 2+1
dimensions, or which in 3+1 dimensions count the number of times a ball or ring
soliton threads through the center of a ring of a different species. We
explicitly construct these terms for our models, and generalize them to cases
where soliton overlaps are no longer strictly forbidden so the terms are no
longer purely topological. One of the (3+1)-dimensional theories we consider
also has topological solitons which consist of two rings (of distinct species)
linked in space.

describes an interaction of a gauge field to an $N\times N$ complex matrix
scalar field transforming as a field in the fundamental representation. In
contrast to the Kazakov-Migdal model the model contains only the linear
interaction between scalar and gauge lattice fields. This model does not suffer
from extra local U(1) symmetries. In an approximation of a translation
invariant master field the large N limit of the model is investigated. At large
N the gauge fields can be integrated out yielding an effective theory
describing an interaction of eigenvalues of the master field. The reduced model
exhibits phase transitions at the points $\beta_{\bar {cr}}$ and $\beta
_{\underline{cr}}$ and the region $(\beta_{\bar{cr}}, \beta_{\underline{cr}})$
separates the strong and weak regions of the model. To study the behaviour of
the model at large $N$ in more systematic way the quenched momentum
prescription with constraints for treating the large N limit of gauge theories
is used. With the help of the technique of orthogonal polynomials nonlinear
equations describing the large N limit of the reduced model {\it with
quenching} are presented.
