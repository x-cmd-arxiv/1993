of its abelian subgroups and of its cyclic subgroups are determined as linear
functions of $c^2_1$. Most of them are the best.

degenerate coframes could occur during topology change of the underlying
spacetime structure. However, the coframe is not the true Yang--Mills type
gauge field of the translations, since it lacks the inhomogeneous gradient term
in the gauge transformations. By explicitly restoring this ``hidden"" piece
within the framework of the affine gauge approach to gravity, one can avoid the
metric or coframe degeneracy which would otherwise interfere with the
integrations within the path integral. This is an important advantage for
quantization.

constructions of it in the classical as well as in the quantum phase space for
the $q$-deformed algebra sl_q(2) are discussed. Moreover, deformation of the
phase space without deforming the generators of sl(2) is considered.
$\hbar$-q-deformation of the phase space is shown to yield the Witten's second
deformation. To study the BFV--BRST cohomology problem when both the quantum
phase space and the group are deformed, a two parameter deformation of sl(2) is
proposed, and its BFV-BRST charge is given.

rules, for any value of k, by looking for all permutations that commute with
the modular matrices S and T. This can be done by using the arithmetic of the
cyclotomic extensions where the problem is naturally posed. When k is divisible
by 3, the automorphism group (Z_2) is generated by the charge conjugation C. If
k is not divisible by 3, the automorphism group (Z_2 x Z_2) is generated by C
and the Altsch\""uler--Lacki--Zaugg automorphism. Although the combinatorial
analysis can become more involved, the techniques used here for SU(3) can be
applied to other algebras.
