  December 30, 1992","Astron.Astrophys.272:161-175,1993",,,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the hot spots in FR-II galaxies as sites of first order Fermi
acceleration of protons to the highest energies observed in cosmic rays. We
estimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the
canonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical
observations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the
proton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source
distibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave
background (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A). We get excellent agreement
with the cosmic ray data points at ultra high energies. THIS PAPER GIVES THE

various mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at
relatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase
transitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly
homogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly
sometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was
suggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving
relatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy.
In this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any
``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of
inhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity
involves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate
significant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that
the large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth
of inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same
inhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios
one can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic
fluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any
particular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but
only by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently
``pathological''.

broken if D is bigger or equal to 2 and N is small enough and the order

we derive a set of general consistency equations that must be satisfied. As
