assumption is that, due to fast convective motions, the free mean path
perpendicular to the magnetic field is independent of energy and has the scale
of the thickness of the shocked layer. I use the basic concept, that the
energetic Cosmic Ray particles are accelerated in a Supernova shock that
travels down a stellar wind. Discussion gives a knee energy expression, which
leads to a suggestion on the physical origin of the mechanical energy of
Supernova explosions, the gravitational potential energy mediated by the
angular momentum and the magnetic field. The spectrum below the knee is
$E^{-8/3}$. At the knee the particles segregate with particle energy according
to their charge. The spectrum beyond the knee is very close to $E^{-3}$. The
theory has been checked successfully against air shower data in two subsequent
papers (Stanev, Biermann, Gaisser, 1992 preprint; Rachen, Stanev, Biermann,

Lagrangian is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, since it yields

(1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills type gauge theory coupled to (1+1)-dimensional
matter fields, where the minimal coupling associated with the diffeomorphism
group of the 2-dimensional spacelike fibre space automatically appears. Written
in the first-order formalism, our Lagrangian density directly yields a non-zero
local Hamiltonian density, where the associated time function is the retarded
time. From this Hamiltonian density, we obtain a positive-definite local
gravitational energy density. In the asymptotically flat space-times, the
volume integrals of the proposed local gravitational energy density over
suitable 3-dimensional hypersurfaces correctly reproduce the Bondi and the ADM
surface integral, at null and spatial infinity, respectively, supporting our

theory is classifiable if it is superstable and does not have either the

showed that if a theory T is classifiable then each model of cardinality lambda
