their Monte Carlo simulations. As a possible explanation of this, they suggest
bit level correlations in the random numbers. However, our tests find no
evidence of such correlations, which highlights the importance of more careful
physical tests of random number generators.

the meson and baryon spectrum and gave a hadron mass formula in surprising
agreement with experiment. The simple quark model dismissed as heresy and
witchcraft by the establishment predicted quantum numbers of an enormous number
of hadronic states as well as relations between masses, reaction cross sections
and electromagnetic properties, all unexplained by other approaches. Further
developments leading to QCD included confinement in the large $N_c$ limit,
duality, dual resonance and string models, high energy scattering systematics,
unified treatment of mesons and baryons, no exotics and no free quarks.

length emerges naturally from any quantum theory of gravity, and that the
concept of black hole is not operationally defined if the mass is smaller than
the Planck mass.

critical behavior of four-Fermion theory at its strong coupling fixed point.
Existence of a solution of the bootstrap equations indicates self-consistency
of the assumption that, in space-time dimensions less than four, the
renormalization group flow of the coupling constant of a four-Fermion
interaction has a nontrivial fixed point which is generally out of the
perturbative regime. We exploit the hypothesis of conformal invariance at this
fixed point to reduce the set of the Schwinger-Dyson bootstrap equations for
four-Fermion theory to three equations which determine the scale dimension of
the Fermion field $\psi$, the scale dimension of the composite field
$\bar{\psi}\psi$ and the critical value of the Yukawa coupling constant. We
solve the equations assuming this critical value to be small. We show that this
solution recovers the fixed point for the four-fermion interaction with
$N$-component fermions in the limit of large $N$ at (Euclidean) dimensions $d$
between two and four. We perform a detailed analysis of the $1/N$-expansion in
$d=3$ and demonstrate full agreement with the conformal bootstrap. We argue
that this is a useful starting point for more sophisticated computations of the
critical indices.
