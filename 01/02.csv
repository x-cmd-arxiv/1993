drastically modify classical general relativity at cosmological distance
scales, resulting in a scale invariant phase of quantum gravity in the far
infrared. We derive scaling relations for the partition function and physical
observables in this conformal phase, and suggest quantitative tests of these
relations in numerical simulations of simplicial four geometries with $S^4$
topology. In particular, we predict the form of the critical curve in the
coupling constant plane, and determine the scaling of the Newtonian coupling
with volume which permits a sensible continuum limit. The existing numerical
results already provide some evidence of this new conformal invariant phase of
quantum gravity.

scattering are discussed in two scenarios with the basic constituents chosen to
be baryon-mesons and quark-gluons respectively in light-cone formalism. It is
found that when taking into account the effect due to internal quark structure
of nucleons, the derived scaling variable for bound nucleons and the calculated
nuclear structure functions are different from those in considering the
baryon-mesons as the effective elementary constituents. This implies that the
pure baryon-meson descriptions of nuclei give the inaccurate off-shell behavior
of the bound nucleon structure function, thereby the quark-gluons seem to be
the most appropriate degrees of freedom for nuclear descriptions. It is also
shown that the EMC effect cannot be explained by nuclear binding effect from a
sound theoretical basis.
