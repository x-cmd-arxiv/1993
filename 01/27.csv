small amplitude vibrations in a granular material. In this model, the
positional disorder in the sample is ignored and the particles are placed on
the vertices of a square lattice. The inter-particle forces are modeled as
linear springs, with the only disorder in the system coming from a random
distribution of spring constants. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model
is able to reproduce the complex frequency response seen in measurements of
sound propagation in a granular system. In order to understand this behavior,
the role of the resonance modes of the system is investigated. Finally, this
simple model is generalized to include relaxation behavior in the force network
-- a behavior which is also seen in real granular materials. This model gives
quantitative agreement with experimental observations of relaxation.
