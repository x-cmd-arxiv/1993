antiferromagnetic first and second-neighbor in-plane interactions, are studied
by extensive histogram Monte Carlo simulations. The results, in conjunction
with the recently determined phase diagram, strongly suggest that the
transition from the period-3 ordered state to the paramagnetic phase remains in
the xy universality class. This conclusion is in contrast with a previous
suggestion of mean-field tricritical behavior.

using a recently developed technique that allows to solve the mean-field model
hamiltonian with a variational calculation. The accuracy of our estimate is
controlled by means of a small parameter $1/q$, analogous to the inverse spin
magnitude $1/s$ employed in studying quantum spin systems. The mathematical
aspects of the method and its connection with other large-spin approaches are
discussed in details. In the large-$q$ limit the problem of strongly correlated
electron systems turns in the minimization of a total energy functional. We
have performed numerically this optimization problem on a finite but large
$L\times L$ lattice. For a single hole the static small-polaron solution is
stable unless for small values of $J$, where polarons of increasing sizes have
lower energy. At finite doping we recover phase separation above a critical $J$
and for any electron density, showing that the Emery {\it et al.} picture
represents the semiclassical behaviour of the {\it t}-{\it J} model. Quantum
fluctuations are expected to be very important especially in the small $J$ --
small doping region, where phase separation may also be suppressed.

dynamically as the unique measure of maximal entropy. Thus $\mu$ is also an
equilibrium measure from the point of view of the thermodynamical formalism. In
