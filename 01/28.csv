as $L\to \infty$ at $n=1$, which defines and yields an analytic expression for
the correlation length $\xi$ in the Mott insulating phase of the model as a
function of the on-site repulsion $U$. In the vicinity of the zero temperature
critical point U=0, $n=1$, we show that the charge stiffness has the
hyperscaling form $D_{\rm c}(n,L,U)=Y_+(\xi \delta, \xi/L)$, where $\delta
=|1-n|$ and $Y_+$ is a universal scaling function which we calculate. The
physical significance of $\xi$ in the metallic phase of the model is that it
defines the characteristic size of the charge-carrying solitons, or {\em
holons}. We construct an explicit mapping for arbitrary $U$ and $\xi \delta \ll
1$ of the holons onto weakly interacting spinless fermions, and use this
mapping to obtain an asymptotically exact expression for the low temperature
thermopower near the metal-insulator transition, which is a generalization to
arbitrary $U$ of a result previously obtained using a weak- coupling
approximation, and implies hole-like transport for $0<1-n\ll\xi^{-1}$.

$\alpha=1$. For bosons the transition is in the universality class of the
classical three-dimensional XY model. Near the Fermion limit, the transition is
described by a massless $2+1$ Dirac theory coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge
field. Analytic calculations perturbative in $\alpha$, and also a large
N-expansion, show that due to gauge fluctuations, the critical properties of
the transition are dependent on the anyon statistics. Comparison with previous
calcualations at and near the Boson limit, strongly suggest that our lattice
model exhibits a fixed line of critical points, with universal critical
properties which vary continuosly and monotonically as one passes from Fermions
to Bosons. Possible relevance to experiments on the transitions between
plateaus in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the magnetic field-tuned
superconductor-insulator transition are briefly discussed.

reflection of a deeper symmetry underlying the standard model. In this paper we
investigate one very elementary possibility, that physics above the grand
unification scale is described by the symmetry group $G\timesSU(3)_{fam}$ with
$G$ a gauged grand unified group, and $SU(3)_{fam}$ a global family symmetry.
The breaking of this symmetry at the GUT scale produces global texture,
providing a mechanism for structure formation in the universe, and sets strong
constraints on the low energy fermion mass matrix. With the addition of a ${\bf
45}$ Higgs and certain assumptions about the relative strength of Higgs
couplings, the simplest $SU(5)$ theory yields an eight parameter form for the
fermion mass matrices, which we show is consistent with the thirteen observable
masses and mixing angles. We discuss the natural suppression of flavour
changing neutral currents (FCNCs) and emphasise the rich low energy Higgs
sector. With minor assumptions, the theory unifies consistently with the recent
LEP data. We consider the extension to $G=SO(10)$, where some simplification
and further predictiveness emerges. Finally we discuss the dynamics of
$SU(3)_{fam}$ texture and show that the known constraints on unification
`predict' a GUT symmetry breaking scale of the order required for cosmic
structure formation, and by the recent detection of cosmic microwave anisotropy
by COBE.
