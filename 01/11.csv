is derived. The formula is non-perturbative and numerically effective, which
allows the Lyapunov exponent to be computed to high accuracy. In particular,
the free energy and the heat capacity are computed for the one-dimensional
Ising model with quenched disorder. The formula is derived by using a Bernoulli
dynamical system to mimic the randomness.

quantities $d^{(p)}(K)$ and $D^{(p)}(K)$ is presented which generalizes
previous expressions with $p=1$ due to Grothendieck and Fredholm. It is also
presented global upper bounds for these quantities. In particular we prove that
$$ |d^{(p)}(K)| \le e^{\kappa \n K \n_p^p} $$ holds with $\kappa = \kappa(p)
\le \kappa(\infty) = \exp \bigl\{-{1 \over 4(1+ e^{2 \pi})} \bigr\}$ for $ p\ge

underscreened Kondo problem may help to understand the nature of magnetism in
heavy fermion systems. Motivated by Doniach's work on the S=1/2 Kondo necklace,
we introduce the underscreened Kondo necklace models with S>1/2. The
underscreened Kondo necklace is the simplest lattice model on which the
competition between Kondo spin compensation, and magnetic ordering due to an
RKKY-type interaction can be examined. We used the mean-field approximation to
determine the phase diagram, and found that the low-temperature phase is always
an x-y antiferromagnet. This contention is further supported by the derivation
of the exact form of the effective hamiltonian in the limit of very large Kondo
coupling: it is found to be an antiferromagnetic x-y model for the residual
(S-1/2)-spins. In general, the degree of moment compensation depends on both
the Kondo coupling, and on S.
