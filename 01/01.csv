cosmological distances, while spectroscopy and intensity histories of some
individual bursts imply an origin on Galactic neutron stars. To resolve this
inconsistency I suggest the presence of two populations, one at cosmological
distances and the other Galactic. I build on ideas of Shemi and Piran (1990)
and of M\'esz\'aros and Rees (1993) involving the interaction of fireball
debris with surrounding clouds to explain the observed intensity histories in
bursts at cosmological distances. The distances to the Galactic population are
undetermined because they are too few to affect the statistics of intensity and
direction; I explain them as resulting from magnetic reconnection in neutron
star magnetospheres.

diffusional, and equivalently, (scalar) elastic properties of the fractal
network. From the numerical calculations of the eigenspectrum of the transition
probability matrix, we find that the spectral dimension $d_s$ and the walk
dimension $d_w$ change suddenly as soon as the floppy ends of a critical
percolation cluster are connected together to form relatively large loops, and
that the additional inclusion of successively smaller loops only change these
exponents little if at all. This suggests that there is a new universality
class associated with the loop-enhanced percolation problem.

shown:
  (i) An embedding is flat if and only if the fundamental group of the
complement in 3-space of the embedding of every subgraph is free.
  (ii) If two flat embeddings of the same graph are not ambient isotopic, then
they differ on a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.
  (iii) Any flat embedding of a graph can be transformed to any other flat
embedding of the same graph by ``3-switches'', an analog of 2-switches from the
theory of planar embeddings. In particular, any two flat embeddings of a
4-connected graph are either ambient isotopic, or one is ambient isotopic to a
mirror image of the other.
  (iv) A graph has a flat embedding if and only if it has no minor isomorphic
to one of seven specified graphs. These are the graphs that can be obtained
from $K_6$ by means of $Y\Delta$- and $\Delta Y$-exchanges.
