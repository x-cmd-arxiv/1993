equations are in the form of Lindblad generators, with imposed constraints that
the dissipations be strictly linear (i.e. ohmic), isotropic and translationally
invariant. A particular form for is chosen to satisfy the constraints. The
resulting master equations are given in both the Schr\""odinger and Heisenberg
forms. We obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations, and discuss the relaxation
of average kinetic energy to effective thermal equilibrium values. We compare
our results to the Dekker and the Caldeira-Leggett master equations. These
master equations allow a more general approach to quantum dissipation and the
dynamics of quantum coherence to account for the nontrivial system-environment
coupling in a local environment.

quantum systems in an arbitrary number of dimensions. We define from the free
energy a function $C$ of the coupling constants and the temperature, which in
the regimes where quantum fluctuations dominate, is a monotonically increasing
function of the temperature. We show that at very low temperatures the system
is controlled by the zero-temperature infrared stable fixed point while at
intermediate temperatures the behavior is that of the unstable fixed point. The
$C$ function displays this crossover explicitly. This behavior is reminiscent
of Zamolodchikov's $C$-theorem of field theories in 1+1 dimensions. Our results
are obtained through a thermodynamic renormalization group approach. We find
restrictions on the behavior of the entropy of the system for a
$C$-theorem-type behavior to hold. We illustrate our ideas in the context of a
free massive scalar field theory, the one-dimensional quantum Ising Model and
the quantum Non-linear Sigma Model in two space dimensions. In regimes in which
the classical fluctuations are important the monotonic behavior is absent.

integral with vanishing extrinsic curvature (vanishing ``momentum'') at the
boundary. Since the final momentum is fixed, its conjugate cannot be specified
freely; consequently, such an instanton will contribute to the wave function at
only one or a few isolated spatial geometries. I show that these geometries are
the extrema of the Hartle-Hawking wave function in the semiclassical
approximation, and provide some evidence that with a suitable choice of time
parameter, these extrema are the maxima of the wave function at a fixed time.

lattices, using the single-cluster Monte Carlo update algorithm. The expected
pronounced reduction of critical slowing down at the phase transition is
verified. This allows simulations on significantly larger lattices than in
previous studies and consequently a better control over systematic errors. In
one set of simulations we employ the usual finite-size scaling methods to
compute the critical exponents $\nu,\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \eta$ from a few
measurements in the vicinity of the critical point, making extensive use of
histogram reweighting and optimization techniques. In another set of
simulations we report measurements of improved estimators for the spatial
correlation length and the susceptibility in the high-temperature phase,
obtained on lattices with up to $100^3$ spins. This enables us to compute
independent estimates of $\nu$ and $\gamma$ from power-law fits of their
critical divergencies.

investigations of the one-Higgs-doublet model, we obtain combined bounds for
the parameters of the model. We find upper limits of 470 GeV for the mass of

single charged pion at an $\Upsilon$ resonance for studies of CP violation in
the neutral $B$ meson system at a symmetric $e^+$-$e^-$ collider. The sign of
the charged pion would tag the neutral $B$ meson. We estimate this branching
ratio, employing the heavy meson chiral effective field theory. We find a
negligible branching ratio to $B B^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$ at the $\Upsilon$(5S) and a
branching ratio of only a few percent at the $\Upsilon$(6S). However, if
nonresonant studies of neutral $B$ mesons should prove feasible, Yamamoto's
proposal could be a good method for tagging neutral $B$'s for the study of CP
violation at a symmetric collider.
  We also explore the possibility of studying $B_s$ at the $\Upsilon$(5S). The
rate is low but depends sensitively on the precise value of the mass of the
$B_s$. The background we compute is comparable to the rate at the largest
allowed value of the $B_s$ mass.
  Finally, we discuss the extraction of the axial pion coupling to $B$ mesons
from measurement of the $B\bbar\pi$ branching fraction in a restricted region
of phase space, where chiral perturbation theory should work well.
