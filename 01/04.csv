parton distribution functions of hadrons, starting from a valencelike input at
low $Q^2$, is discussed. In particular, we consider the prescription of Barone
{\em et al} who evolve from $Q^2 = 0$, and that of Gl\""uck {\em et al} who
start evolution from $Q^2 \simeq (2\Lambda_{QCD})^2$.

angular distributions in the decays $\tau\to\nu_\tau \eta\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$,
$\tau\to\nu_\tau K^- \pi^{-} K^+ $ and $\tau\to\nu_\tau K^- \pi^- \pi^+$.
Radial excitations of the $K^*$, which cannot be seen in $e^++e^-$, should be
observed in the $ K^- \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay channel.

can be contracted consistently by singular scaling of some of the generators.
For the later case, by a contraction which depends on the central term, we
obtain a new $N=4$ superconformal algebra which contains an $SU(2)\times
{U(1)}^4$ Kac-Moody subalgebra and has nonzero central extension.
