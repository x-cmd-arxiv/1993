  preprint number",,"10.1086/172724",,"astro-ph",,"  We present spectrophotometric observations of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy OQ
208 (Mrk 668, 1404+286) obtained between 1985 and 1991. We show that the Balmer
line fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of
intensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased
monotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components
of Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have
discovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement
and the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when
the line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not
compatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving
ballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a
system of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift
and luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems
that most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the
clouds. Theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed Hbeta profile is
best fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical or
confined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shell
contained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.

theories in which the Universe today is flat and matter dominated, and
primordial perturbations are adiabatic parameterized by an index $n$. In this
class of theories the predicted signal in the South Pole experiment depends not
only on $n$, but also on the Hubble constant and the baryon density. For $n=1$
a large region of this parameter space is ruled out, but there is still a
window open which satisfies constraints coming from COBE, measurements of the
age of the Universe, the South Pole experiment, and big bang nucleosynthesis.
Using the central values of the Hubble constant and baryon density favored by
nucleosynthesis and age measurements, we find that, even if the COBE
normalization drops by $1\sigma$, $n > 1.2$ is ruled out.

BRST analysis and the matrix model approach. Since the two dimensional
centrally extended Poincar\'e algebra is naturally embedded in the centrally
extended $w_\infty$ algebra, the low energy action for the metric and dilaton
appears naturally when the model is truncated at this level. We give a
plausible explanation of emergence of discrete states in this formulation. This
theory is again the effective theory at zero slope limit. To include higher
order $\alpha'$ corrections, we speculate that the whole theory is a gauge
theory of a deformed $w_\infty$ algebra, and the deformation parameter is just
$\alpha'$.
