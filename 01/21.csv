experimentally in the dc-current by varying the pulse length in a train of
voltage pulses. The nonlinear current due to an ac-bias also shows complex
time-dependence.

due to the non-monochromatic nature of the photon beams produced by the
laser-backscattering method, the resultant cross section for Higgs production
is much smaller than the on-resonance cross section and generally {\it
decreases} with increasing collider energy. Although continuum $ZZ$ production
is expected to be negligible, we demonstrate the presence of and calculate
sizeable backgrounds from $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-Z,\,q\bar qZ$,
with $Z\rightarrow q\bar q,\,\ell^+\ell^-$, respectively, and
$\gamma\gamma\rightarrow t\bar t\rightarrow b\bar b\ell^+\ell^-\nu\bar\nu$.
This channel may be used to detect a Higgs of mass $m_H$ up to around 350~GeV

magnitude. Given the importance of these processes for both hadron spectroscopy
and CP-violation studies at $\phi$ factories (where $\phi \rightarrow K^0 \bar
K^0 \gamma$ poses a possible background problem), this state of affairs is very
undesirable. We show that the variety of predictions is due in part to errors
and in part to differences in modelling. The latter variation leads us to argue
that the radiative decays of these scalar states are interesting in their own
right and may offer unique insights into the nature of the scalar mesons. As a
byproduct we find that the branching ratio for $\phi\rightarrow
K^0\bar{K}^0\gamma$ is $\lapproxeq 0(10^{-7})$ and will pose no significant
background to proposed studies of CP-violation.
