fireball. We show that, after an early rearrangement phase, most of the matter
and energy in the fireball is concentrated within a narrow shell. The shell
propagates at nearly the speed of light, with a frozen radial profile and
according to a simple set of scaling laws. The spectrum of the escaping
radiation is harder at early times and softer later on. The results are
applicable to models of $\gamma$-ray bursts. Submitted to Monthly Notices of

because the experimental Higgs boson mass limit is weakened due to the smaller
production rate and the presence of sizeable invisible decays involving majoron
emission, or due to the effect of additional electrically charged scalar bosons
which substantially modify the condition for succesful baryogenesis.

and most attractive scheme to modify the standard model but also may already
have some ``experimental"" support. The crucial test may be to observe a short--
lived axion--like $\eta_6$ of mass around 60 GeV/$c^2$ that can produce high
energy photon pairs diffractively at hadron colliders and also radiatively from
$Z^0$ at high energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Here we show how high--energy forward
scattering can be affected by diffractive production of the $\eta_6$. Presented

breaking of dilatation symmetry by the mass parameters of the scalar potential
is removed by means of a dilaton field. Starting from the one-loop
renormalization group improved potential, we discuss the ground state of the
theory. The flat direction in the classical potential is lifted by quantum
corrections and the true vacua are found. Studying the finite temperature
potential, we analyze the cosmological consequences of a Jordan-Brans-Dicke
dilaton and show that the lepton number is spontaneously broken after the
electroweak phase transition, thus avoiding any constraint coming from the
requirement of the preservation of the baryon asymmetry in the early Universe.
We also find that, contrary to the Standard Model case, the dilaton cosmology
does not impose any upper bound on the scale of the spontaneous breaking of
scale invariance.

first quantised language. We argue that on quantising the relativistic scalar
particle in spacetime with Minkowski signature, we should study both
propagations $e^{i(p^2-m^2)\tilde \lambda}$ and $e^{-i(p^2-m^2)\tilde \lambda}$
on the particle world line. The path integral needs regulation at the mass
shell $p^2=m^2$. If we regulate the two propagations independently we get the
Feynman propagator in the vacuum, and its complex conjugate. But if the
regulation mixes the two propagations then we get the matrix propagator
appropriate to perturbation theory in a particle flux. This formalism unifies
the special cases of thermal fluxes in flat space and the fluxes `created' by
Cosmological expansion, and also gives covariance under change of particle
definition in curved space. We comment briefly on the proposed application to
closed strings, where we argue that coherent fields and `exponential of
quadratic' particle fluxes must {\it both} be used to define the background for
perturbation theory.

non-zero at higher orders of $1/k$ even if it vanishes at large $k$. We work

$SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ and one abelian, i.e $SL(2,\IR)\otimes
