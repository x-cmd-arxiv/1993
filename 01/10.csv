decoherence decoherence functional are equal to the relative frequencies of the
results of many identical experiments, when a set of alternative histories
decoheres. We consider both cases of the pure and mixed initial states.

analytic knot theory to the loop representation. We discuss the role that the
Jones Polynomial plays as a generator of nondegenerate quantum states of the
gravitational field.

is obtained by gauging an extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in two
space-time dimensions. This algebra is obtained by an unconventional
contraction of the super de Sitter algebra. Besides the generators of the super
de Sitter algebra it has one more fermionic generator and two more bosonic
generators one of them being a central charge. The gauging of this algebra is
performed in the usual way. Unlike some proposals for a dilaton supergravity
theory we obtain a model which is non-local in the gravitino field.
