preserving diffeomorphisms that does not possess this shortcoming. The proposed
definition has the futher advantage of coinciding with the dynamical definition
based on the invariance of the action ( in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian form). We
explicitly verify the equivalence of the Lagrangian covariant phase space with

  The 130 GeV T-quark mass is consistent with the analysis of Dalitz and

consistent with the theoretical calculations of Dimopoulos, Hall, and Raby that
the T-quark mass range should be 176 to 190 GeV [2].
  The calculation uses a model in which the 28-dimensional adjoint
representation of Spin(8) forms the gauge group of the model with an
8-dimensional spacetime whose tangent vector space is represented by the vector
representation of Spin(8); the first generation fermion particles and
antiparticles are represented by the two mirror image 8-dimensional half-spinor
representations of Spin(8). The 8-dimensional spacetime of the model is reduced
to 4 dimensions. Dimensional reduction gives the fermions a 3-generation
structure.

expansion of models of 2D gravity coupled to general $(p,q)$ conformal matter.
In a previous work it was proven that at large order $k$ the string
susceptibility had a generic $a^k\Gamma(2k-\ud)$ behaviour. Moreover the
constant $a$, relevant for the problem of Borel summability, was determined for
all one-matrix models. We here obtain a set of equations for this constant in
the general $(p,q)$ model. String equations can be derived from the
construction of two differential operators $P,Q$ satisfying canonical
commutation relations $[P,Q]=1$. We show that the equation for $a$ is
determined by the form of the operators $P,Q$ in the spherical or semiclassical
limits. The results for the general one-matrix models are then easily
recovered. Moreover, since for the $(p,q)$ string models such $p=(2m+1)q\pm1$
the semiclassical forms of $P,Q$ are explicitly known, the large order
behaviour is completely determined. This class contains all unitary $(q+1,q)$
models for which the answer is specially simple. As expected we find that the
topological expansion for unitary models is not Borel summable.

notion of vertex operator algebra in terms of operads is presented. This
reformulation shows that the rich geometric structure revealed in the study of
conformal field theory and the rich algebraic structure of the theory of vertex
operator algebras share a precise common foundation in basic operations
associated with a certain kind of (two-dimensional) ``complex'' geometric
object, in the sense in which classical algebraic structures (groups, algebras,
Lie algebras and the like) are always implicitly based on (one-dimensional)
``real'' geometric objects. In effect, the standard analogy between

more fundamental mathematical level.

amplitude is generated by $N{\bar{N}}$ loops and thus driven entirely by the
neutron-proton mass difference. The value of the amplitude at the
$\omega$-meson point is expressed in terms of only the $NN\omega$ and the
$NN\rho$ coupling constants. Using values for these couplings constrained by
empirical two-nucleon data we obtain a value for the mixing amplitude in
agreement with experiment. Extending these results to the spacelike region, we
find a $\rho-\omega$ contribution to the NN interaction that is strongly
suppressed and opposite in sign relative to the conventional contribution
obtained from using the constant on-shell value for the mixing amplitude.
