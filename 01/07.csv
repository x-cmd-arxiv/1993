neutrino conversion resonances, appearance of resonances in the
neutrino-antineutrino ($\nu_{lL}\leftrightarrow\bar{\nu}_{lR}$) transition
channels, neutrino-antineutrino resonant conversion, large amplitude

global $U(1)$ symmetry. However, it may be argued that all global symmetries
will be explicitly violated by gravitational effects. We show that it is
possible to preserve most of the usual features of majoron models by invoking
$U(1)_{B-L}$ to be a gauge symmetry and adding a second singlet scalar field.
The majoron gets a small model dependent mass. The couplings of majorons to
neutrinos may be of ordinary strength or may be made arbitrarily weak. We
discuss the cosmological and astrophysical consequences of majoron models in
the context of a model dependent majoron mass and neutrino coupling. For an
appropriate choice of parameters majorons can play the role of dark matter.

this paper we propose a new gauge theory for the geodesic field of closed and
open strings. Our approach solves the technical and conceptual problems
affecting previous attempts to describe strings in terms of local field
variables. The connection between the geodesic field, the string current and
the Kalb-Ramond gauge potential is discussed and clarified. A non-abelian
generalization and the generally covariant form of the model are also
discussed.

to the presence of pre--equilibrium emitted particles, is studied in a
schematic model of nuclear multi- fragmentation. The source of the
intermittency signal is modeled with a percolating system. The efficiency is
schematized by a simple function of the fragment size, and the presence of
pre--equilibrium particles is simulated by an additional non--critical fragment
source. No selection on the events is considered, and therefore all events are
used to calculate the moments. It is found that, despite the absence of event
selection, the intermittency signal is quite resistant to the distortion due to
the apparatus efficiency, while the inclusion of pre--equilibrium particles in
the moment calculation can substantially reduce the strength of the signal.
Pre--equilibrium particles should be therefore carefully separated from the
rest of the detected fragments, before the intermittency analysis on
experimental charge or mass distributions is carried out.
