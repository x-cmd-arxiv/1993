extending from 0.7 pc west to 1.2 pc east of Ori theta 1C. The lines arise in
warm gas with T > 40 K. The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di-
rection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35
K more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum
velocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at
the map boundaries. The density of the emitting gas is > 10^4 cm^-3 and the
column density exceeds 10^21 cm^-2. The correlation of the bright, narrow
CO(7-6) lines with 158 micron [C II] emission suggests that over the entire
region mapped, the narrow CO lines arise in warm photo-dissociation regions ex-
cited by UV photons from the Trapezium cluster. Although the Trapezium stars
lie in front of the Orion A molecular cloud, not all of the warm gas is at the
cloud surface. To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo-
city components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several
arcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other
must arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular
cloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a
cross-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of
shock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity
of the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission.

the boundary conditions of the universe. We analyse the consequences of the no
boundary proposal, the only reasonably complete set of boundary conditions that
has been put forward. We study perturbations of a Friedmann model containing a
massive scalar field but our results should be independent of the details of
the matter content. We find that gravitational wave perturbations have an
amplitude that remains in the linear regime at all times and is roughly time
symmetric about the time of maximum expansion. Thus gravitational wave
perturbations do not give rise to an Arrow of Time. However density
perturbations behave very differently. They are small at one end of the
universe's history, but grow larger and become non linear as the universe gets
larger. Contrary to an earlier claim, the density perturbations do not get
small again at the other end of the universe's history. They therefore give
rise to a Thermodynamic Arrow of Time that points in a constant direction while
the universe expands and contracts again. The Arrow of Time does not reverse at
the point of maximum expansion. One has to appeal to the Weak Anthropic
Principle to explain why we observe the Thermodynamic Arrow to agree with the
Cosmological Arrow, the direction of time in which the universe is expanding.

  consisted of less than half of the manuscript.)",,,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  The authors have introduced recently a ``microcanonical functional integral""
which yields directly the density of states as a function of energy. The phase
of the functional integral is Jacobi's action, the extrema of which are
classical solutions at a given energy. This approach is general but is
especially well suited to gravitating systems because for them the total energy
can be fixed simply as a boundary condition on the gravitational field. In this
paper, however, we ignore gravity and illustrate the use of Jacobi's action by
computing the density of states for a nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator.

is used to constrain SO(10) models. We consider the case of one (heavy)
generation, with the tree-level relation $m_b=m_\tau$, calculating the limits
on the intermediate symmetry breaking scales. This analysis extends previous
analyses which addressed only the simplest symmetry breaking schemes. In the
case where the low energy model is the standard model with one Higgs doublet,
there are very strong constraints due to the known limits on the top mass and
the tau neutrino mass. The two Higgs doublet case is less constrained. Finally
we address the role of a speculative constraint on the tau neutrino mass,
arising from the cosmological implications of anomalous $B+L$ violation in the
early universe.

(Corrected date and abstract.)","Commun.Math.Phys. 166 (1994) 337-366","10.1007/BF02112319",,"hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  The Hamiltonian structure of the monodromy preserving deformation equations
of Jimbo {\it et al } is explained in terms of parameter dependent pairs of
moment maps from a symplectic vector space to the dual spaces of two different
loop algebras. The nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems generating the
deformations are obtained by pulling back spectral invariants on Poisson
subspaces consisting of elements that are rational in the loop parameter and
identifying the deformation parameters with those determining the moment maps.
This construction is shown to lead to ``dual'' pairs of matrix differential
operators whose monodromy is preserved under the same family of deformations.
As illustrative examples, involving discrete and continuous reductions, a
higher rank generalization of the Hamiltonian equations governing the
correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas is obtained, as well as dual
pairs of isomonodromy representations for the equations of the Painleve
transcendents $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$.
