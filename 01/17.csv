may be supplemented by two Higgs scalar doublets. They may be remnants of the
spontaneous breaking of an SU(2) X SU(2) X U(1) gauge symmetry at a much higher
energy scale. In one case, the two-doublet Higgs potential has a custodial
SU(2) symmetry and implies an observable scalar triplet. In another, a light
neutral scalar becomes possible.
