  preprint number",,"10.1086/173189",,"astro-ph",,"  Dynamical friction due to field stars and tidal disruption caused by a
central nucleus are crucial in determining the evolution of the globular
cluster system in an elliptical galaxy. In this paper I examine the possibility
that some of galactic nuclei have been formed by frictionally decayied globular
clusters moving in a triaxial potential. The initial rapid growth of the
nucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time
scale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption
induced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by
Ostriker, Binney & Saha.
  The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the
galaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but
the actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated.
  The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the
two mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial,
velocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family. Moreover, we
discuss the possibility that the globular cluster fall to the galactic centre
has been cause of primordial violent galactic activity.
  An application of the model to M31 is presented.

{r^\alpha\over\xi}\cdot g\left( {r-r_0}\over \xi \right)$, where $g(x)$ denotes
some scaling function which is centered around zero and has a width of order

  Jacobson, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1993)",,,,"gr-qc hep-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurement is a fundamental notion in the usual approximate quantum
mechanics of measured subsystems. Probabilities are predicted for the outcomes
of measurements. State vectors evolve unitarily in between measurements and by
reduction of the state vector at measurements. Probabilities are computed by
summing the squares of amplitudes over alternatives which could have been
measured but weren't. Measurements are limited by uncertainty principles and by
other restrictions arising from the principles of quantum mechanics. This essay
examines the extent to which those features of the quantum mechanics of
measured subsystems that are explicitly tied to measurement situations are
incorporated or modified in the more general quantum mechanics of closed
systems in which measurement is not a fundamental notion. There, probabilities
are predicted for decohering sets of alternative time histories of the closed
system, whether or not they represent a measurement situation. Reduction of the
state vector is a necessary part of the description of such histories.
Uncertainty principles limit the possible alternatives at one time from which
histories may be constructed. Models of measurement situations are exhibited
within the quantum mechanics of the closed system containing both measured
subsystem and measuring apparatus. Limitations are derived on the existence of
records for the outcomes of measurements when the initial density matrix of the
closed system is highly impure. (Festschrift for Dieter Brill).

  used for initial times; mostly changes in figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  I estimate the degree of local chemical equilibration for $\pi$, $\rho$ and
$\omega$ mesons in ultra--relativistic nuclear collisions. The $\pi$ and $\rho$
mesons remain near chemical equilibrium in all cases, while the $\omega$ meson
density is typically 30--50\% higher than the equilibrium value for O+Ag
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=20$ GeV. If chemical reactions are turned off, the
$\omega$ meson density is much larger, 2.5--3 times its equilibrium value.
Thus, $\omega$ mesons may provide the most sensitive tests for the degree of
chemical equilibration in nuclear collisions.
