Sciama et al. (1993) argued that because of high central concentration the DM
in that cluster must be baryonic. We study the DM profile in clusters of
galaxies simulated using the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum of density
fluctuations, and an amplitude previously derived from numerical simulations
(Melott 1984b; Anninos et al. 1991) and in agreement with microwave background
fluctuations (Smoot et al. 1992). We find that with this amplitude
normalization cluster neutrino DM densities are comparable to observed cluster
DM values. We conclude that given this normalization, the cluster DM should be
at least largely composed of neutrinos. The constraint of Davidsen et al. can
be somewhat weakened by the presence of baryonic DM; but it cannot be
eliminated given our assumptions.

ionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. By
fitting the results of time dependent disk models to observed time scales of
FU~Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effeciency of the effective
viscous stress in the inner disk (r < 1 AU) to be, in accordance with the ad
hoc ``alpha'' prescription, 10^{-4} where hydrogen is neutral and 10^{-3} where
hydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their
outer disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU~Orionis
outbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which
transport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be
ionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of 5x10^{-7} solar
masses / year {\it independent of the magnitude of alpha} for systems with one
solar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the
range of (1-10)x10^{-6} solar masses per year produce observed FU~Orionis time
scales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse
rates.

find that the NGC 2300 group has a baryonic fraction out to $25'$ of at least
20\%, thus over five times higher than in the original analysis of Mulchaey

nucleosynthesis, but similar to the other two groups as well as rich clusters.
With this baryonic fraction, groups would be fair tracers of the distribution
of baryons in the Universe if $\Omega h_{50}^2 = 0.3$. A baryonic fraction that
increases with radius is consistent with the X-ray data from all three groups.
However, a detailed analysis of the NGC 2300 group shows that the dependence of
baryonic fraction on radius is not well constrained by the data, in part
because of uncertainties in the estimated background.

functions of n complex variables z_1,...,z_n and three additional parameters

can be degenerated into many interesting special functions -- hypergeometric
and q-hypergeometric functions, elliptic and modular functions, transcendental
functions of an elliptic curve, vector-valued modular forms, solutions of the
Bethe ansatz equations etc.
  The main result of the paper states that these functions satisfy two
holonomic systems of difference equations -- the first one has shift parameter
p and elliptic modulus s, and the second one has shift parameter s and elliptic
modulus p.

antisymmetric second-rank tensor fields as matter fields rather than gauge
fields known for a long time. The free action is conformally rather than gauge
invariant. The quantization of the free fields is analyzed and the one-loop
renormalization-group functions are evaluated. Transverse free waves are found
to convey no energy. The coupling constant of the axial-vector abelian gauge
interaction exhibits asymptotically free ultraviolet behavior, while the
self-couplings of the tensor fields do not asymptotically diminish.

distinct cluster structure of coherent pion production in the rapidity

reaction mechanism (SV quark model) is used in a DWBA calculation of $\bar
\Lambda \Lambda$ production in $\bar p p$ interractions. Total and differential
cross-sections, polarizations, depolarizations, and spin-correlattion
coefficients are computed for laboratory momenta from threshold to 1695 MeV/c.
The free parameters of the calculation are the scalar and vector strengths, a
quark cluster size parameter,and the parameters of the unknown $\bar \Lambda
\Lambda$ potentials. Good agreement with experiment is found for constructive
interference of the scalar and vector terms, and for $\bar \Lambda \Lambda$
potentials which differ from those suggested by several authors on the basis of
SU(3) arguments. The fit to the data is better than that obtained by other
quark models, which use only scalar $or$ vector annihilation terms. The
agreement with experiment is also better than that found in meson-exchange
models. The recent suggestion[1] that measurement of the depolarization
parameter $D_{nn}$ can be used to discriminatebetween meson-exchange and quark
models is examined in detail. We conclude that a measurement of $D_{nn}$ will
provide a test of which of these models, as presently constructed,is the more
appropriate description of strangeness production in the $\bar p p \ rightarrow
\bar \Lambda \Lambda$ reaction.

are calculated for $^{48}Ca$, $^{76}Ge $, $^{82}Se$, $^{100}Mo$, $^{128}Te$ and
$^{130}Te$ nuclei, using a ${\delta}$-interaction. As a guide, to fix the
particle-particle interaction strengths, we exploit the fact that the missing
symmetries of the mean field approximation are restored in the random phase
approximation by the residual interaction. Thus, the T=1, S=0 and T=0, S=1
coupling strengths have been estimated by invoking the partial restoration of
the isospin and Wigner SU(4) symmetries, respectively. When this recipe is
strictly applied, the calculation is consistent with the experimental limit for
the $2\nu$ lifetime of $^{48}Ca$ and it also correctly reproduces the $2\nu$
lifetime of $^{82}Se$. In this way, however, the two-neutrino matrix elements
for the remaining nuclei are either underestimated (for $^{76}Ge$ and
$^{100}Mo$) or overestimated (for $^{128}Te$ and $^{130}Te$) approximately by a
factor of 3. With a comparatively small variation ($<10%$) of the spin-triplet
parameter, near the value suggested by the SU(4) symmetry, it is possible to
reproduce the measured $T_{1/2}^{2\nu}$ in all the cases. The upper limit for
the effective neutrino mass, as obtained from the theoretical estimates of
$0\nu$ matrix elements, is $<m_{\nu}>\cong 1$ eV. The dependence of the nuclear
matrix elements on the size of the configuration space has been also analyzed.
