dilation. Our measures of time scale are constructed to avoid selection effects
arising from intensity differences by rescale all bursts to fiducial levels of
peak intensity and noise bias. The three tests involved total count rate above
background, wavelet decomposition, and alignment of the highest peaks. In all
three tests, the dim bursts are stretched by a factor of about two relative to
the bright ones, over seven octaves of time scale. We calibrated the
measurements by dilating synthetic bursts that approximate the temporal

BATSE's peak-flux completeness limit being at cosmological distances
corresponding to $z \sim 1$, and thus with independent cosmological
interpretations of the BATSE number-intensity relation.

producing the massive quark (where gluon-fusion is dominant) to the very high

Minkowski finite-element lattice. The equations of motion have been derived so
as to preserve lattice gauge invariance and have been shown to be unitary. In
addition, species doubling is avoided due to the nonlocality of the
interactions. The model is used to investigate the lattice current algebra.
Regularization of the current is shown to arise in a natural and nonarbitrary
way. The commutators of the lattice current are calculated and shown to have
the expected qualitative behavior. These lattice results are compared to
various continuum calculations. (Five figures available from author.)

E$_8$, which describes the scaling limit of the Ising model in a magnetic
field. He conjectured that there also exist solvable lattice models based on
E$_8$ in the universality class of the Ising model in a field. The dilute A$_3$
model is a solvable lattice model with a critical point in the Ising
universality class. The parameter by which the model can be taken away from the
critical point acts like a magnetic field by breaking the $\Integer_2$ symmetry
between the states. The expected direct relation of the model with E$_8$ has
not been found hitherto. In this letter we study the thermodynamics of the
dilute A$_3$ model and show that in the scaling limit it exhibits an
appropriate E$_8$ structure, which naturally leads to the E$_8$ scattering
theory for massive excitations over the ground state.

potential that confines quarks into hadrons and avoids color van der Waals
forces. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate $R(q,w)$\ in one
space dimension for a variety of momentum transfers $q$\ and excitation
energies $w$. The response function decreases with density (compared to a free
hadron response) because of quark exchange between hadrons.
