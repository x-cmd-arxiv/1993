large $N$ limit, where $N$ is the number of `colors'. For large values of the
four-fermion coupling we find a phase in which both, flavor symmetry and
parity, are spontaneously broken. In accordance with general expectations there
are three massless pions on the phase boundary, but only two of them remain
massless inside the broken phase. This is analogous to earlier results obtained
in lattice QCD, indicating that this behavior is a very general feature of the
Wilson term.

  (TeX file)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Since the TRIVIALITY argument of the Higgs sector requires the existence of
new physics beyond the standard model, there should exist a cutoff $\Lambda$
beyond which the standard model will breakdown. The cutoff can be determined
from the position of the Landau pole. We study the effects of this cutoff on
the energy of the electroweak sphaleron, $E^{spha}$, in the large Higgs boson
mass limit. We found that $E^{spha}$ becomes arbitrarily large as the Higgs
boson mass increases. This is in contrast to the well-known result, which is
held in the standard model and a wide class of its extensions, that $E^{spha}$
is stable against the variation of the {\it bare} Higgs boson mass. The
physical meaning of this result is discussed.

consistent background for $N=2$ closed superstring theory in $2+2\-$dimensions,
can accommodate the recently discovered two-dimensional dilaton gravity black
hole solution, {\it via} appropriate dimensional reductions and truncations.
Interestingly, the usual dilaton field in this set of solutions emerges from
the scalar field in the ${\bf 70}\-$dimensional representation of an intrinsic
global $SO(8)$ group. We also give a set of exact solutions, which can be
interpreted as the dilaton field on Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton
background, realized in an $N=1$ self-dual supergravity theory. This suggests
that the $N=2$ superstring has a close (even closer) relationship with the
two-dimensional black hole solution, which was originally developed in the
context of bosonic string and $N=1$ superstring. Our result also provides
supporting evidence for the conjecture that the $N=2$ superstring theory is the
``master theory'' of supersymmetric integrable systems in lower-dimensions.
