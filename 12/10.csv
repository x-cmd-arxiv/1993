motivated differential calculus on non-commutative or quantum spaces, providing
powerful but easy-to-use mathematical tools for applications in physics and
related sciences. A generalization of unitary time evolution is proposed and
studied for a simple 2-level system, leading to non-conservation of microscopic
entropy, a phenomenon new to quantum mechanics. A Cartan calculus that combines
functions, forms, Lie derivatives and inner derivations along general vector
fields into one big algebra is constructed for quantum groups and then extended
to quantum planes. The construction of a tangent bundle on a quantum group
manifold and an BRST type approach to quantum group gauge theory are given as
further examples of applications. The material is organized in two parts: Part
I studies vector fields on quantum groups, emphasizing Hopf algebraic
structures, but also introducing a `quantum geometric' construction. Using a
generalized semi-direct product construction we combine the dual Hopf algebras
\A\ of functions and \U\ of left-invariant vector fields into one fully
bicovariant algebra of differential operators. The pure braid group is
introduced as the commutant of $\Delta (\U)$. It provides invariant maps $\A
\to \U$ and thereby bicovariant vector fields, casimirs and metrics. This
construction allows the translation of undeformed matrix expressions into their
less obvious quantum algebraic counter parts. We study this in detail for
quasitriangular Hopf algebras, giving the determinant and

the Grassmann algebra to the paragrassmann ones. The main aim is constructing
an algebraic basis for representing `fractional' symmetries appearing in $2D$
integrable models and also introduced earlier as a natural generalization of
supersymmetries. We have shown that these algebras are naturally related to
quantum groups with $q = {\rm root \;of \; unity}$. By now we have a general
construction of the paragrassmann calculus with one variable and preliminary
results on deriving a natural generalization of the Neveu--Schwarz--Ramond
algebra. The main emphasis of this report is on a new general construction of
paragrassmann algebras with any number of variables, N. It is shown that for
the nilpotency indices $(p + 1) = 3, 4, 6$ the algebras are almost as simple as
the Grassmann algebra (for which $(p + 1) = 2$). A general algorithm for
deriving algebras with arbitrary p and N is also given. However, it is shown
that this algorithm does not exhaust all possible algebras, and the simplest
example of an `exceptional' algebra is presented for $p = 4, N = 4$.

  93/36",,,,"hep-th",,"  This is a review on infinite non-abelian symmetries in two-dimensional field
theories. We show how any integrable QFT enjoys the existence of infinitely
many {\bf conserved} charges. These charges {\bf do not commute} between them
and satisfy a Yang--Baxter algebra. They are generated by quantum monodromy
operators and provide a representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras
$U_q({\hat\G})$. We review the work by de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on the
bootstrap construction of the quantum monodromy operators in classically scale
invariant theories where the classical monodromy matrix is conserved. Then, the
recent generalization to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring) model, where
such operators do not possess a classical analogue is given (This provides a
representation of $S{\hat U}(2)_q$). It is then reported on the recent work by
Destri and de Vega, where both commuting and non-commuting integrals of motion
are systematically obtained by Bethe Ansatz in the light-cone approach. The
eigenvalues of the six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ are
explicitly computed on a generic physical state through algebraic Bethe ansatz.
In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$ turns out to be a two--valued periodic
function. One determination generates the local abelian charges, including
energy and momentum, while the other yields the abelian subalgebra of the
(non--local) YB algebra. In particular, the bootstrap results coincide with the
ratio between the two determinations of the lattice transfer matrix.[Based on a
Lecture at the Clausthal Symposium].
