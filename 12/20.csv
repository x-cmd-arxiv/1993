objects in the spheroid, the spheroid could be responsible for microlensing
events for sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We show that, although
the rate of events is lower than predicted by a galactic halo made of
microlensing objects, it is still significant for EROS/MACHO observations.
Because of the different matter distributions in the halo and spheroid
components, a comparison between microlensing event rates in the LMC, future
measurements of microlensing in the galactic bulge and, possibly, in M31 can
provide information about the amounts of dark objects in the different galactic

demonstrate that the method works well as long as $c \leq 1$. For $c >1$ it is
not clear what distribution to expect. However, we observe strikingly similar
distributions for various kinds of matter fields with the same $c$. This
indicate that there might be some range of $c >1$ where the central charge of
the matter fields alone determines the fractal structure of gravity coupled to
matter. The hypothesis that the string susceptibility $\g = 1/3$ is found to be
compatible with the data for $1 < c \leq 4$.

  Quantization","39 pages (LaTeX), report T93/139","Commun.Theor.Phys. 4 (1995) 1-38",,,"hep-th",,"  The role of a physical phase space structure in a classical and quantum
dynamics of gauge theories is emphasized. In particular, the gauge orbit space
of Yang-Mills theories on a cylindrical spacetime (space is compactified to a
circle) is shown to be the Weyl cell for a semisimple compact gauge group,
while the physical phase space coincides with the quotient $\R^{2r}/W_A$, $r$ a
rank of a gauge group, $W_A$ the affine Weyl group. The transition amplitude
between two points of the gauge orbit space (between two Wilson loops) is
represented via a Hamiltonian path integral over the physical phase space and
explicitly calculated. The path integral formula appears to be modified by
including trajectories reflected from the boundary of the physical
configuration space (of the Weyl cell) into the sum over pathes. The Gribov
problem of gauge fixing ambiguities is considered and its solution is proposed
in the framework of the path integral modified. Artifacts of gauge fixing are
qualitatively analyzedwith a simple mechanical example. A relation between a
gauge-invariant description and a gauge fixing procedure is established.

formulation of field theory is proposed. We start from the Hamilton-
Poincar\'{e}-Cartan (HPC) form of the multidimensional variational calculus and
define the bracket on the differential forms over the space-time (=horizontal
forms). This bracket is related to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of the
multivector fields which are associated with the horizontal forms by means of
the ""polysymplectic form"". The latter is given by the HPC form and generalizes
the symplectic form to field theory. We point out that the algebra of forms
with respect to our Poisson bracket and the exterior product has the structure
of the Gerstenhaber graded algebra. It is shown that the Poisson bracket with
the DW Hamiltonian function generates the exterior differential thus leading to
the bracket representation of the DW Hamiltonian field equations. Few
illustrative examples are also presented.

the chiral symmetric to the chiral non-symmetric phase. When the curvature
grows and (or) the radius of ${\rm S}^1$ decreases, then the phase transition
is in general of first order. The dynamical fermionic mass is also calculated

cranking about z-axis but correcting for the orientation fluctuation of the

we find that the x-axis cranking results are satisfactory for reasonably heavy
nuclei and this offers a computationally faster method to include the angular

that at high spins inclusion of orientation fluctuation correction would be
important.
