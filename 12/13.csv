of blue galaxies at intermediate redshift$^{1-5}$. These galaxies represent a
significant excess over the expectation of standard cosmological models for
reasonable amounts of evolution of the locally observed galaxy population.
However, the surveys which define the local galaxy population are strongly
biased against objects of low surface brightness$^{6-9}$. Low surface
brightness galaxies have properties very similar to those of the excess blue
population$^{10,11}$, and recent work suggests that they are comparable in
abundance to the more readily detected normal galaxies$^{9,12}$. I show that
the very deep surveys which reveal the excess population can easily detect low
surface brightness galaxies to large redshifts, but that local surveys will
miss them because they are not comparably sensitive. This suggests that the
excess faint galaxies {\it are\/} low surface brightness galaxies. No
alteration of standard cosmology is required, but it is necessary to reconsider
the way in which the galaxy distribution function is specified.

  Bursters","7 pages of Tex, accepted in MNRAS, WIS-93/95/PH",,"10.1093/mnras/267.4.1035",,"astro-ph",,"  Relativistic electron-positron winds with strong magnetic fields are
considered as a source of radiation for cosmological $\gamma$-ray bursters.
Such a wind is generated by a millisecond pulsar with a very strong magnetic
field. An electron-positron plasma near the pulsar is optically thick and in
quasi-thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that the main part of radiation
from the pulsar wind is nonthermal and generates in the following way. Kinetic
energy which is released in the process of deceleration of the neutron star
rotation transforms mainly to the magnetic field energy. The magnetic field is
frozen in the outflowing plasma if the distance to the pulsar is smaller than
$\sim 10^{13}$ cm. This field transfers the energy from the pulsar environment
to the region outside the $\gamma$-ray photosphere of the electron-positron
wind. At a distance of more than $\sim 10^{13}$ cm the magnetohydrodynamic
approximation for the pulsar wind is broken, and intense electromagnetic waves
are generated. The frequency of these waves is equal to the frequency of the
pulsar rotation. Outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of intense
electromagnetic waves to Lorentz factors of the order of $10^6$ and generate
nonthermal synchro-Compton radiation. The typical energy of nonthermal photons
is $\sim 1$ MeV. A high-energy tail of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum may be up to
$\sim 10^4$ MeV. Baryonic matter is ejected occasionally from the pulsar
magnetosphere. The baryonic matter ejection and subsequent suppression of the
$\gamma$-ray emission may be responsible for the time structure of $\gamma$-ray
bursts.

agrees with the A.D.M. energy in the limit that deviations from flat space
remain localized as the toroidal radii become infinite.

Kronfeld and Mackenzie, compared with the weaker dependence observed for the

method. The operator method also suffers more from finite-size effects due to a
finite thickness of the interface, leading us to conclude that the integral
method yields more reliable values for $\sigma$. Our result with the integral
method $\sigma/T_c^3=0.134(16)$ is consistent with earlier results and also
with that obtained with a transfer matrix method. Result is also reported on
