radiation (CBR) from a local collapse described by a spherical over-dense
region embedded in a flat universe, with the emphasis on the relationship
between the dipole $(\Delta {\sf T}/{\sf T})_d$ and the quadrupole $(\Delta
{\sf T}/{\sf T})_q$ anisotropy. This result has been used to examine the
kinematic quadrupole correction $(\Delta {\sf T}/{\sf T})_q=(\Delta {\sf
T}/{\sf T})_d^2/2$, which is usually applied to remove the contamination of the
quadrupole produced by local density inhomogeneities when finding the cosmic
amplitude of the quadrupole at the surface of last scattering. We have found
that the quadrupole of local collapse origin cannot always be approximately
described by the kinematic quadrupole. Our numerical result shows that the
difference between the kinematic and local quadrupoles depends on the size and
matter density in the peculiar field, and the position of the observer. For a
given dipole, the local quadrupole can be different from the kinematic
quadrupole by a factor as large as 3. Therefore, the kinematic quadrupole
correction remains an uncertain factor in the determination of the amplitude of
a cosmic quadrupole. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis shows that this
uncertainty might not dramatically change the cosmological origin of the
COBE-DMR's quadrupole, unless a huge peculiar gravitational field is assumed.

  lensing","4 pages, 2 figures (not included) by fax, A&A submitted, DAEC-OPM-93","Astron.Astrophys.286:748-752,1994",,,"astro-ph",,"  Quasar-galaxy associations, if they result from the effect of gravitational
lensing by foreground galaxies, depend sensitively on the shape of the quasar
number counts. Two kinds of quasar number-magnitude relations are predicted to
produce quite different properties in quasar-galaxy associations: the counts of
Boyle, Shanks and Peterson (1988; BSP) provide both positive and ``negative""
associations between distant quasars and foreground galaxies, relating closely
with the knee ($B\approx19.15$) in these counts. However, Hawkins and V\'eron
(1993; HV) quasar data lead to only a positive magnitude-independent
quasar-galaxy association. The current observational evidence on quasar-galaxy
associations, either positive or null, is shown to be the natural result of
gravitational lensing if quasars follow the BSP number-magnitude relation. On
the other hand, the HV counts are unable to produce the reported associations
by the mechanism of gravitational lensing. It is emphasized that special
attention should be paid to the limiting magnitudes in the selected quasar
samples when one works on quasar-galaxy associations.

exponential disk while a face-on exponential disk is used for the stellar
distribution of the LMC. Among the microlensing events discovered by the MACHOs
and EROS projects, a fraction of $22\%$ could be caused by the lenses near the
center of the LMC or $13\%$ from lenses at $5^o$ from the LMC center.
Therefore, any statistical study of these microlensing events must take the LMC
lenses into account.

clusters of galaxies due to the effect of gravitational lensing by clusters of
galaxies. Similar to the well-known quasar-galaxy ones, these associations
depend sensitively on the shape of galaxy number-magnitude or number-flux
relation, and both positive and ``negative"" associations are found to be
possible, depending on the limiting magnitude and/or the flux threshold in the
surveys. We calculate the enhancement factors assuming a singular isothermal
sphere model for clusters of galaxies and a pointlike model for background
sources selected in three different wavelengths, $B$, $K$ and radio. Our
results show that $K-$ selected galaxies might constitute the best sample to
test the ``negative"" associations while it is unlikely that one can actually
observe any association for blue galaxies. We also point out that bright radio
sources ($S>1$ Jy) can provide strong positive associations, which may have
been already detected in 3CR sample.

can probe the phase angle $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle. We identify the
more promising of these ``$\gamma$ modes,'' estimate their branching ratios,
and examine the degree to which they are theoretically clean. We then show that
when the quark mixing matrix is not approximated as usual, but is treated
exactly, none of the ``$\gamma$ modes'' actually measures $\gamma$. Rather,
each of them measures $\gamma$ plus some correction. In all modes, the
correction is small enough to be disregarded in first-generation experiments,
but in some of them, it may be large enough to be observed in second-generation
experiments. Our treatment of the $\gamma$ modes calls attention to the fact
that when the quark mixing matrix is treated exactly, there are six unitarity
triangles, rather than just one triangle. However, only four of the angles in
these six triangles are independent. Examining the role played by these four
angles, we discover that, in principle at least, measurements of nothing but
CP-violating asymmetries in $B$ decays are sufficient to determine the entire
quark mixing matrix.
