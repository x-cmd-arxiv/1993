  in July in Paris, Ed. Bouchet & Lachieze-Rey",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper covers the material of our two talks. We describe a series of
projects based upon perturbative expansions to follow the gravitational
evolution of the one point probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the
density contrast field and for the divergence of the corresponding velocity
field. The Edgeworth expansion greatly simplifies the problem. Indeed, the PDF
can be described through several low order moments, with the first non-trivial
contribution coming from the skewness, or third moment. Gaussian initial
conditions imply that the skewness of the smoothed density field is
proportional to the square of the variance. The constant of proportionality is
then a function of the logarithmic slope of the variance versus scale, and is
otherwise independent of scale. This constant is also practically independent
of the density parameter $\Omega$, and has very nearly the same value when
distances are estimated by redshifts. To show the latter property, we also
briefly discuss our Lagrangian approach to perturbation theory. Finally, the
observed skewness does depend, of course, on the relation between the
distribution of light and mass; we describe the case of local biasing. For the
divergence of the velocity field, the skewness of its PDF is also proportional
to the square of its variance, but the ratio now strongly depends on the value
of $\Omega$. This offers a new method to determine the density parameter which
does not involve comparisons

pronounced beating pattern. This has been explained by the interference of
three isolated classical periodic orbits with nearby actions and periods. A
singular magnetic flux line, passing through the origin, drastically alters the
beats even though the classical Lagrangean equations of motion remain
unchanged. Some of the changes can be easily understood in terms of the
Aharonov-Bohm effect. However, we find that the standard periodic orbit theory
does not reproduce the diffraction-like quantum effects on those classical
orbits which intersect the singular flux line, and argue that corrections of
relative order $\hbar$ are necessary to describe these effects. We also discuss
the changes in the distribution of nearest-neighbour spacings in the eigenvalue
spectrum, brought about by the flux line. pacs{PACS numbers: 05.45.+b,

that the original theory is unphysical. We explicitly show how to map, in the

study energetics for asymptotically flat solutions. This is based on the
second-order dynamics obtained, without changing the metric, by the use of a
Helmholtz Lagrangian. We prove for a large class of these Lagrangians that the
ADM energy is positive for solutions close to flat space. The proof of this
Positive Energy Theorem relies on the existence of the Einstein frame, since in

the field variables are unrelated to the total energy of the system.

supersymmetric massive theories.The basic data required are the vacua and the
spectrum of Bogomolnyi solitons, which can be neatly encoded in a graph
(nodes=vacua and links= Bogomolnyi solitons). Integrability is then equivalent
to the existence of solutions of a generalized Yang-Baxter equation which is
built up from the graph (graph-Yang-Baxter equation). We solve this equation
for two general types of graphs: circular and daisy, proving, in particular,
the inte- grability of the following Landau-Ginzburg superpotentials: A_n(t_1),
A_n(t_2), D_n(\tau),E_6(t_7), E_8(t_16). For circular graphs the solutions are
intertwiners of the affine Hopf algebra $\tilde(U)_q(A^{(1)}_1)$, while for
daisy graphs the solution corresponds to a susy generalization of the Boltzmann
weights of the chiral Potts model in the trigonometric regime. A chiral Potts
like solution is conjectured for the more tricky case $ D_n(t_2)$. The
scattering theory of circular models, for instance $A_n(t_1)$ or $D_n(\tau)$,
is Toda like. The physical spectrum of daisy models, as $A_n(t_2), E_6(t_7)$ or
$E_8(t_16)$, is given by confined states of radial solitons. The scattering
theory of the confined states is again Toda like. Bootstrap factors for the
confined solitons are given by fusing the susy chiral Potts S-matrices of the
elementary constituents, i.e. the radial solitons of the daisy graph.

physical states of a given string theory. In particular, it has been shown that
any bosonic string theory can be embedded in a particular $N{=}1$ string
background in such a way that the spectrum and the amplitudes of both theories
agree. Similarly, it is also known that the amplitudes of any $N{=}1$ string
theory can be obtained from a particular $N{=}2$ string background. When
rephrased in the language of BRST cohomology, these results suggest a close
connection to the theory of induced representations. The purpose of this note
is to investigate this connection further and at the same time to reveal the
mechanism behind these embeddings between string theories. We will first
analyze the embedding of an affine algebra $\gghat$ in the $N{=}1$ affine
algebra associated to $\gg$. Given any BRST cohomology theory for $\gghat$ we
will be able to construct one for the $N{=}1$ affine algebra associated to
$\gg$ such that the cohomologies agree as operator product algebras. This is
proven in two different ways. This example is the simplest in its kind and, in
a sense that is made precise in the paper, all other similar embeddings are
deformations of this one. We conclude the paper with a brief treatment of the
general case, where we prove that for a particular class of ``good''
embeddings, the cohomologies are again isomorphic.
