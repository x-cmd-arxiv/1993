by large-angle fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We
consider primordial adiabatic perturbations and discuss power spectra that are
power laws in volume, wavelength, and eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. The
resulting large-angle anisotropies of the CMB are computed. The amplitude
generally increases as $\Omega$ is decreased, but decreases as $h$ is
increased. Interestingly enough, for all three ansatzes, anisotropies on
angular scales larger than the curvature scale are suppressed relative to the
anisotropies on scales smaller than the curvature scale. Models with
$0.2<\Omega h<0.3$ appear compatible with CMB fluctuations detected by COBE and
Tenerife and with the amplitude and spectrum of fluctuations of galaxy counts
in galaxy surveys. COBE normalization for these models yields $\sigma_8\simeq
0.5-0.7$. Models with smaller values of $\Omega h$ when normalized to COBE
require bias factors in excess of 2 to be compatible with the observed galaxy
counts on the $8/h$ Mpc scale. Requiring that the age of the universe exceed 10
Gyr implies that $\Omega>0.25$, while requiring that the age exceed 13 Gyr
implies that $\Omega>0.35$. Unlike in the flat-Universe case where the
anisotropy comes only from the last-scattering term in the Sachs-Wolfe formula,
large-angle anisotropies come primarily from the decay of potential
fluctuations at $z<1/\Omega$. Thus, if the Universe is open, COBE has been
detecting fluctuations produced at moderate redshift rather than at $z\sim
1300$.

Solutions of the Einstein equations which are periodic and have standing
gravitational waves are valuable approximations to more physically realistic
solutions with outgoing waves. A variational principle is found which has the
power to provide an accurate estimate of the relationship between the mass and
angular momentum of the system, the masses and angular momenta of the
components, the rotational frequency of the frame of reference in which the
system is periodic, the frequency of the periodicity of the system, and the
amplitude and phase of each multipole component of gravitational radiation.
Examination of the boundary terms of the variational principle leads to
definitions of the effective mass and effective angular momentum of a periodic
geometry which capture the concepts of mass and angular momentum of the source
alone with no contribution from the gravitational radiation. These effective
quantities are surface integrals in the weak-field zone which are independent
of the surface over which they are evaluated, through second order in the
deviations of the metric from flat space.

in the case of fermionic string theories. It is pointed out that symmetric
orbifold models cannot be rewritten into torus models in the case of fermionic
string theories because of the absence of twist-untwist intertwining currents
on the orbifold models. We present a list of current algebras on asymmetric
$Z_N$-orbifold models of type II superstring theories with inner automorphisms
of Lie algebra lattices of the $A_n$ series. It turns out that whether an
asymmetric orbifold model is rewritten into a torus model depends on the
specific choice of a momentum lattice and an inner automorphism of the lattice.

Rev.Lett71(1993)3405) Dirac quantization procedure is not properly followed as
a result of which the resulting quantum theory is different from what one will
get by a straightforward application of Dirac's formulation. For example at
quantum level the model in I has noncommutative geometry, i.e., $[x_\mu, x_\nu]
\neq 0$ while a correct treatment would give $[x_\mu, x_\nu] = 0$. Moreover,
their assertion about $\alpha$ being an arbitrary constant in $S_\mu = -\alpha
p_\mu /{\sqrt{p^2}} $ is not correct and consequently one can not say whether
the model describes anyons.

explicite formulae given for $D=4$ Poincar\'{e} algebra $(\hat{g}={\cal P}_4).$
The comultiplications of twisted $U^F({\cal P}_4)$ are obtained by conjugating
primitive classical coproducts by $F\in U(\hat{c})\otimes U(\hat{c}),$ where
$\hat{c}$ denotes any Abelian subalgebra of ${\cal P}_4$, and the universal
$R-$matrices for $U^F({\cal P}_4)$ are triangular. As an example we show that
the quantum deformation of Poincar\'{e} algebra recently proposed by Chaichian
and Demiczev is a twisted classical Poincar\'{e} algebra. The interpretation of
twisted Poincar\'{e} algebra as describing relativistic symmetries with
clustered 2-particle states is proposed.
