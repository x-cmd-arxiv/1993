pulsar 1E 2259 + 586 may be such a white dwarf. It is shown that in this case
starquakes may be responsible for the decrease of the mean spin-down rate which
was observed for 1E 2259 + 586 between 1987 and 1990. The required mass of the
white dwarf which is identified with 1E 2259 + 586 is $\sim 1.4 - 1.5 M_\odot$,
making this X-ray pulsar the most massive white dwarf known.

Fundamental gravitational field variables are dreibein fields and Lorentz gauge
potentials, and the theory is underlain with the Riemann-Cartan space-time. The
most general gravitational Lagrangian density, which is at most quadratic in
curvature and torsion tensors and invariant under local Lorentz transformations
and under general coordinate transformations, is given. Gravitational field
equations are studied in detail, and solutions of the equations for weak
gravitational fields are examined for the case with a static, \lq \lq spin""less
point like source. We find, among other things, the following: (1)Solutions of
the vacuum Einstein equation satisfy gravitational field equations in the
vacuum in this theory. (2)For a class of the parameters in the gravitational
Lagrangian density, the torsion is \lq \lq frozen"" at the place where \lq \lq
spin"" density of the source field is not vanishing. In this case, the field
equation actually agrees with the Einstein equation, when the source field is
\lq \lq spin""less. (3)A teleparallel theory developed in a previous paper is
\lq \lq included as a solution"" in a limiting case. (4)A Newtonian limit is
obtainable, if the parameters in the Lagrangian density satisfy certain
conditions.

using data from low energy experiments as well as from high energy
accelerators. Similarly to the case of scalar leptoquarks, we find that the
strongest indirect bounds arise from atomic parity violation and universality
in leptonic pi decays. These bounds are considerably stronger than the first
direct bounds of HERA, restricting vector leptoquarks that couple with
electromagnetic strength to right-handed quarks to lie above 430 GeV or 460
GeV, and leptoquarks that couple with electromagnetic strength to left-handed
quarks to lie above 1.3 TeV, 1.2 TeV and 1.5 TeV for the SU(2)_W singlet,

SD equation there is a corresponding approximation to the BS equations such
that the solutions to those equations satisfy the Ward-Takahashi identities of
the external gauge symmetry. This formulation also clarifies the way how we can
calculate the Green functions of current operators in a consistent manner with
the gauge invariance and the axial anomaly. We show which type of diagrams for
the $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ amplitude using the pion BS amplitude give
result consistent with the low-energy theorem. An interesting phenomenon is
observed in the ladder approximation that the low energy theorem is saturated
by the zeroth order terms in the external momenta of the pseudoscalar BS
amplitude and the vector vertex functions.
