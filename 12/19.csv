revealed the presence of at least two components in the X-ray spectra of X-ray
faint early-type galaxies: a relatively hard component (kT>1.5 keV), and a very
soft component (kT\sim 0.2-0.3 keV). We address the problem of the nature of
the very soft component, and whether it can be due to a hot interstellar medium
(ISM), or is most likely originated by the collective emission of very soft
stellar sources. To this purpose, hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences for the
secular behavior of gas flows in ellipticals have been performed, and the
results are compared with the observational X-ray data: the very soft component
could be entirely explained with a hot ISM only in galaxies where the depth of
the potential well is quite shallow, otherwise the softest contribution to the
X-ray emission comes certainly from stellar sources. As stellar soft X-ray
emitters, we consider late-type stellar corone, supersoft sources such as those
discovered by ROSAT in the Magellanic Clouds and M31, and RSCVn systems. We
finally present a model for the X-ray emission of NGC4365, to reproduce in
detail the results of the ROSAT pointed observation (PSPC spectrum and radial
surface brightness distribution).

mirror fermions respectively, we show that the Wilson lattice fermion can
originate from a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon. Ward identities, due
to symmetries at the cutoff, guarantee the cancellation of mirror-fermion
contributions and the infrared limit can be achieved. The Wilson parameter
turns out to be fixed at $r\simeq 0.18$, where the vacuum energy of the system
is minimized.
