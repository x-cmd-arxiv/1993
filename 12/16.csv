of multipole coefficients. We then focus on applications to large angular scale
anisotropies, such as those measured by the {\em COBE} DMR, calculating the
contribution to these quantities from primordial, inflation generated, scalar
perturbations, via the Sachs--Wolfe effect. Using the techniques of stochastic
inflation we are able to provide a {\it universal} expression for the ensemble
averaged three--point function and for the corresponding skewness, which
accounts for all primordial second--order effects. These general expressions
would moreover apply to any situation where the bispectrum of the primordial
gravitational potential has a {\em hierarchical} form. Our results are then
specialized to a number of relevant models: power--law inflation driven by an
exponential potential, chaotic inflation with a quartic and quadratic potential
and a particular case of hybrid inflation. In all these cases non--Gaussian
effects are small: as an example, the {\em mean} skewness is much smaller than
the cosmic {\em rms} skewness implied by a Gaussian temperature fluctuation
field.

introduce a time-dependent viscosity into the system. The evolution of the

an effect. In these models there are observational constraints arising from
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, large-scale galactic

studied. The techniques are Wald's Noether charge approach introduced recently,
and a field redefinition method developed in this paper. Wald's results are
extended by establishing that his local geometric expression for the black hole
entropy gives the same result when evaluated on an arbitrary cross-section of a
Killing horizon (rather than just the bifurcation surface). Further, we show
that his expression for the entropy is not affected by ambiguities which arise
in the Noether construction. Using the Noether charge expression, the entropy
is evaluated explicitly for black holes in a wide class of generally covariant
theories. Further, it is shown that the Killing horizon and surface gravity of
a stationary black hole metric are invariant under field redefinitions of the
metric of the form $\bar{g}_{ab}\equiv g_{ab} + \Delta_{ab}$, where
$\Delta_{ab}$ is a tensor field constructed out of stationary fields. Using
this result, a technique is developed for evaluating the black hole entropy in
a given theory in terms of that of another theory related by field
redefinitions. Remarkably, it is established that certain perturbative, first

significance of these results for the problem of finding the statistical origin

In addition, we demonstrate a flatness problem in MAD Brans-Dicke gravity. In
general, in any model that addresses the horizon problem, including inflation,
there are two components to the flatness issue: i) at the Planck epoch
curvature gains importance, and ii) during accelerated expansion curvature
becomes less important and the universe flattens. In many cases the universe
must be very flat at the Planck scale in order for the accelerated epoch to be

has been calculated for e+e- and hh data in a wide range of energies. As a
function of the rank it exhibits a regular behaviour with a steep descent and
two negative minima. This behaviour is not accounted for by NBD, that leads to
a monotonically decreasing positive-defined ratio. A rough comparison with QCD
predictions is done: data cannot be accounted for by LLA nor by DLA; only some
next-to-next to leading predictions are in qualitative agreement with them.
Such features being appropriate for hard processes and high energies, it is a
surpri- se to find them not only in e+e- annihilation, but also in soft hh
collisions.

  16/1993","Int.J.Theor.Phys.36:281-343,1997","10.1007/BF02435737",,"hep-th",,"  Based on a methodological analysis of the effective action approach certain
conceptual foundations of quantum field theory are reconsidered to establish a
quest for an equation for the effective action. Relying on the functional
integral formulation of Lagrangian quantum field theory a functional integral
equation for the complete effective action is proposed which can be understood
as a certain fixed point condition. This is motivated by a critical attitude
towards the distinction artificial from an experimental point of view between
classical and effective action. While for free field theories nothing new is
accomplished, for interacting theories the concept differs from the established
paradigm. The analysis of this new concept is concentrated on gauge field
theories treating QED as the prototype model. An approximative approach to the
functional integral equation for the complete effective action of QED is
exploited to obtain certain nonperturbative information about the quadratic
kernels of the action. As particular application the approximative calculation
of the QED coupling constant $\alpha$ is explicitly studied. It is understood
as one of the characteristics of a fixed point given as a solution of the
functional integral equation proposed. Finally, within the present approach the
vacuum energy problem is considered and possible implications on the induced
gravity concept are contemplated.
