G which we measure at present is determined by the value of the Brans--Dicke
scalar field \phi at the end of inflation. However, due to quantum fluctuations
of the scalar fields produced during inflation, the gravitational constant
G(\phi) may take different values in different exponentially large parts of the
Universe. We investigate the probability distribution P_p to find a domain of a
given volume with a given value of the gravitational constant G at a given
time. The investigation is performed for a wide class of effective potentials
of the scalar field \sigma which drives inflation, and with two different time
parametrizations. Our work is based on the analytical study of the diffusion
equations for P_p, as well as on the computer simulation of stochastic
processes in the inflationary Universe. We have found that in some inflationary
models the probability distribution P_p rapidly approaches a stationary regime.
The shape of the distribution depends, however, on the choice of the time
parametrization. In some other models the distribution P_p is not stationary.
An interpretation of our results and of all ambiguities involved is outlined,

However, no concentration of gas has been observed in the central 2 kpc. The

those obtained for HI. We found that the molecular gas dominates in the central
5 kpc region, while HI does in the outer region, clearly separated by a
``molecular front'' at 5 kpc radius. This molecular front will be the place
where the phase change from HI to molecular hydrogen, or vice versa, is taking
place in a galactic scale. The central deficiency of the molecular gas is
exceptional for a late type galaxy, which was found for the first time among Sc

elliptical galaxies (dE's) in the Fornax cluster. The blue spectra of Fornax dE
galaxies indicate a wide range of metallicities at a given luminosity, similar
to those of intermediate to \it metal-rich globular clusters. Metal abundances
derived in this paper are well correlated with optical colors and agree with
previous spectroscopic results. A discrepancy with metallicities inferred from
infrared colors is evident; possible causes include an intermediate age
population and dilution of spectral features by a blue light excess. Dwarf
ellipticals exhibit a wide variation of hydrogen line strength which points to
a complex star formation history. Prominent Balmer absorption lines are the
signature of a young stellar population in the nuclei of some (but not all)
dE's, while moderately strong Balmer lines in relatively metal-rich dE's are
more consistent with an extended main sequence. The velocity distribution of
the Fornax dwarfs is flatter than that of brighter galaxies at the 75\%
confidence level, possibly indicating a difference in the kinematics of the two

left. Contrary to the widespread belief that it is sufficient to keep only
terms linear in $\Delta t$ in the expansion if one is only interested in the
final result through order $\Delta t$, we find that all terms in the expansion
must be retained. We solve the combinatorical problem of summing the infinite
series in closed form through order $\Delta t$. Our results straightforwardly
generalize to higher orders in $\Delta t$. We then include fermions for which
we use coherent states in phase space. For supersymmetric $N{=}1$ and $N{=}2$

original Van Vleck determinant the propagator factorizes into a classical part,
this super determinant and the extra scalar curvature term which was first
found by DeWitt for the purely bosonic case by imposing the Schr\""{o}dinger

theories, we note that the operator ordering in the corresponding quantum

topology $S^1 \times S^2 \times R$ in a theory with a massless periodic scalar
field and electromagnetism. These solutions carry winding number of the
periodic scalar as well as magnetic flux. They induce violations of a
quasi-topological conservation law which conserves the product of magnetic flux
and winding number on the background spacetime. I extend these solutions to a
model with stable loops of superconducting cosmic string, and interpret them as
contributing to the decay of such loops.

  (abstract and introduction clarified, minor corrections added)","Phys. Rev. D 51, 2872 (1995)","10.1103/PhysRevD.51.2872",,"hep-th",,"  The most general homogeneous monodromy conditions in $N{=}2$ string theory
are classified in terms of the conjugacy classes of the global symmetry group
$U(1,1)\otimes{\bf Z}_2$. For classes which generate a discrete subgroup $\G$,
the corresponding target space backgrounds ${\bf C}^{1,1}/\G$ include half
spaces, complex orbifolds and tori. We propose a generalization of the
intercept formula to matrix-valued twists, but find massless physical states
only for $\Gamma{=}{\bf 1}$ (untwisted) and $\Gamma{=}{\bf Z}_2$ (\`a la Mathur
and Mukhi), as well as for $\Gamma$ being a parabolic element of $U(1,1)$. In
particular, the sixteen ${\bf Z}_2$-twisted sectors of the $N{=}2$ string are
investigated, and the corresponding ground states are identified via
bosonization and BRST cohomology. We find enough room for an extended multiplet
of `spacetime' supersymmetry, with the number of supersymmetries being
dependent on global `spacetime' topology. However, world-sheet locality for the
chiral vertex operators does not permit interactions among all massless
`spacetime' fermions.

negative cosmological constant is investigated when the spacetime has the
topology ${\bf R}\times T^{2}$. The physical phase space is shown to be a
direct product of two sub-phase spaces having symplectic structures with
opposite signs. Each sub-phase space is found to be a non-Hausdorff manifold
plus a set of measure zero. Geometrical interpretation of each point in the
phase space is also given. A prescription to quantize this phase space is
proposed.
