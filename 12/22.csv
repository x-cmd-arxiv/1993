that the abundance ratio of Mg/Fe, and consequently also O/Fe in giant
elliptical galaxies is not solar. The line strengths of two Fe lines at 5270
and 5335 A are weaker than one expects from the strength of the Mg b line if
[Mg/Fe] = 0. We have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the Mg and
Fe abundances of these galaxies. For these models we have calculated new
evolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of Mg/Fe abundances.
This is the first time that such tracks have been generated. Integrating along
isochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical bright
giant elliptical [Mg/Fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. We show that this
result is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content and
mixing length parameter. The total metal content is super-solar, but the iron
metallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.
For the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the Mg and Fe abundances
has the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from SNe
II, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more O
and Mg than Fe. It means that most of the stars have to be formed within a
period of $3 \times 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapse
phase of the galaxy.

  report # 93/47, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A self-consistent model for binary evolution devised by Gingold \& Monaghan
(1980) is used to show that two distinctly different types of behaviour are
possible for close eccentric binaries. The model is based on a linear adiabatic
normal mode analysis of the problem, which allows detailed examination of the
transfer of energy from the orbit to the tides. We show that for most binaries,
energy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so
that the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circularization
takes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron
separations, {\it chaotic} behaviour prevails, with the eccentricity following
a random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single
periastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that
transferred during the initial periastron passage.
  These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture
binaries. The standard model (see, for example, McMillan, McDermott \& Taam
1987) assumes that the energy transferred to the tides during a periastron
encounter is independent of the oscillatory state of the stars, and that the
amount of tidal energy present at any time can be calculated using a formula
which (accurately) gives the amount deposited after the first encounter (Press
\& Teukolsky 1977). The calculations presented here show that a self-consistent
treatment is necessary in order to study the dynamical evolution of tidal
capture binaries. We conclude that the tidal capture process would not be
possible were it not for the existence of chaotic behaviour.

  report # 93/48, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A self-consistent, adiabatic model for the {\it long-time} behaviour of tidal
capture binaries is presented. It is shown that most capture orbits behave
chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the
values of $\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron
separation at capture.
  If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and
violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly
circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than
previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously
thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the
cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly
bound, highly eccentric phase.
  If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular
clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a
period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.
  We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a
globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \&
Paczy\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\odot$.

pulsar binaries, and cataclysmic binaries which abound in globular clusters.

commutation relations introduced by Greenberg, Bozejko, and Speicher, and the
twisted canonical (anti-)commutation relations studied by Pusz and Woronowicz,
as well as the quantum group S$_\nu$U$(2)$. Using these relations, any
polynomial in the generators $a_i$ and their adjoints can uniquely be written
in ``Wick ordered form'' in which all starred generators are to the left of all
unstarred ones. In this general framework we define the Fock representation, as
well as coherent representations. We develop criteria for the natural scalar
product in the associated representation spaces to be positive definite, and
for the relations to have representations by bounded operators in a Hilbert
space. We characterize the relations between the generators $a_i$ (not
involving $a_i^*$) which are compatible with the basic relations. The relations
may also be interpreted as defining a non-commutative differential calculus.
For generic coefficients $T_{ij}^{k\ell}$, however, all differential forms of
degree 2 and higher vanish. We exhibit conditions for this not to be the case,
and relate them to the ideal structure of the Wick algebra, and conditions of
positivity. We show that the differential calculus is compatible with the
involution iff the coefficients $T$ define a representation of the braid group.
This condition is also shown to imply improved bounds for the positivity of the
Fock representation. Finally, we study the KMS states of the group of gauge
transformations defined by $a_j\mapsto\exp(it)a_j$.

phase display curious similarities to those encountered in the statement of the
Borel-Weil-Bott theorem of the representation theory. The remarkable relation
of the geometric phase to the classification of complex line bundles provides
the necessary tools for establishing the relevance of the Borel-Weil-Bott
theorem to Berry's adiabatic phase. This enables one to define a set of
topological charges for arbitrary compact connected semisimple dynamical Lie
groups. In this paper, the problem of the determination of the parameter space
of the Hamiltonian is also addressed. A simple topological argument is
presented to indicate the relation between the Riemannian structure on the
parameter space and Berry's connection. The results about the fibre bundles and
group theory are used to introduce a procedure to reduce the problem of the
non-adiabatic (geometric) phase to Berry's adiabatic phase for cranked
Hamiltonians. Finally, the possible relevance of the topological charges of the
geometric phase to those of the non-abelian monopoles is pointed out.

operators in conformally invariant theories in arbitrary dimensions {\absit d}
are described. As a consequence the three point function for the energy
momentum tensor has three linearly independent forms for general {\absit d}
compatible with conformal invariance. The corresponding coefficients may be
regarded as possible generalisations of the Virasoro central charge to {\absit
d} larger than 2. Ward identities which link two linear combinations of the
coefficients to terms appearing in the energy momentum tensor trace anomaly on
curved space are discussed. The requirement of positivity for expectation
values of the energy density is also shown to lead to positivity conditions
which are simple for a particular choice of the three coefficients.
Renormalisation group like equations which express the constraints of broken
conformal invariance for quantum field theories away from critical points are
postulated and applied to two point functions.\hfill\break Talk presented at

  Thirring model, with left and right handed fermions transforming under
different representations of the symmetry group. We also point out that the
classical WZW model with a compact target space has a canonical formalism in
which the current algebra is an affine Lie algebra of non--compact type.
  Also, there are some non--unitary quantizations of the WZW model in which
there is invariance only under half the conformal algebra (one copy of the
  Virasoro algebra).

are particularly useful in contexts such as forming simple separable two

equation using real and symmetric matrices. In general, the spectrum of such an
equation may contain complex eigenvalues. But to each complex eigenvalue there
is a corresponding conjugate partner. In studies using realistic
nucleon--nucleon potentials, and in certain positive energy intervals, these
complex conjugated pairs indeed appear in the Sturmian spectrum. However, as we
demonstrate herein, it is possible to recombine the complex conjugate pairs and
corresponding states into a new, sign--definite pair of real quantities with
which to effect separable expansions of the (real) nucleon--nucleon reactance
matrices.

nucleus with interacting point-nucleons and an isolated nucleon with confined
quarks. Defining as an intermediary structure functions in terms of the
non-relativistic limit of light-cone variables, we subsequently conjecture a
generalization to the relativistic regime. That result contains a nuclear part
with full inter-nucleon dynamics and allows the study of approximations, as are
the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation and a modification of it. The framework
also permits a clean treatment of the response of a moving composite nucleon in
the nucleus which may be off-shell.
