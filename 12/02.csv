these two features into a very robust statistic, median group rms velocity
$v_{\rm gr}(f_{\rm gr})$ as a function of the fraction $f_{\rm gr}$ of galaxies
in groups. Using this statistic, we compare ``observed'' simulations to CfA

remains a promising model, with for example $v_{\rmgr}(0.45) \approx 125 \pm 25

based upon the standard solar model and the simplest version of the standard
electroweak theory. If standard electroweak theory is correct, the energy
spectrum for \b8 neutrinos created in the solar interior must be the same (to
one part in $10^5$) as the known laboratory \b8 neutrino energy spectrum.
Direct comparison of the chlorine and the Kamiokande experiments, both

the CLEO limits on the $b\to s\gamma$ rate, (ii) the long-standing limit on the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (iii) the non-observation of anomalous

  Indication of a Strong Tensor Force""","12 pages LaTeX and 2 figures (available upon request), UI-NTH-9312",,,,"nucl-th",,"  In his recent publication of a NN phase shift analysis below 160 MeV, Henneck
reports relatively large values for the mixing parameter $\epsilon_1$. Based on
these results, Henneck suggests that the strength of the $\rho$-meson tensor
coupling to the nucleon may be weaker than used in present day NN interactions,
like the Paris or Bonn potentials. We point out that at low energies ( < 100
MeV ) there is very little sensitivity to the strength of the $\rho$ coupling,
due to the compensating effect of the second order tensor term. In order to
establish sensitivity, one has to go to energies > 200 MeV, where the second
order contribution has gone out. As it happens, the $\epsilon_1$ mixing
parameter is well determined in the region of energies 200--300 MeV, and there
is agreement with the predictions by the Paris and Bonn potentials; whereas the
weak-$\rho$ model is about 50\% above the data. This and additional
considerations in triplet $P$-waves re-confirm that NN scattering requires the
strong $\rho$, consistent with the $\pi\pi-N\bar{N}$ partial-wave analysis by
H\""ohler and Pietarinen.

sets trinucleon potential models and four types of three-dimensional
relativistic three-body equations suggested in the preceding paper. The
relativistic correction to binding energy may vary a lot and even change sign
depending on the relativistic formulation employed. The deviations of these
observables from those obtained in nonrelativistic models follow the general
universal trend of deviations introduced by off- and on-shell variations of
two- and three-nucleon potentials in a nonrelativistic model calculation.
Consequently, it will be difficult to separate unambiguously the effect of off-
and on-shell variations of two- and three- nucleon potentials on low-energy
three-nucleon observables from the effect of relativistic dynamics.
