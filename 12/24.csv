A10 (1995) 4537-4562","10.1142/S0217751X95002102",,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  We derive the uncertainty relation for a quantum open system comprised of a
Brownian particle interacting with a bath of quantum oscillators at finite
temperature. We examine how the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the
environment contribute to the uncertainty in the canonical variables of the
system. We show that upon contact with the bath (assumed ohmic in this paper)
the system evolves from a quantum-dominated state to a thermal-dominated state
in a time which is the same as the decoherence time in similar models in the
discussion of quantum to classical transition. This offers some insight into
the physical mechanisms involved in the environment-induced decoherence
process. We obtain closed analytic expressions for this generalized uncertainty
relation under the conditions of high temperature and weak damping separately.
We also consider under these conditions an arbitrarily-squeezed initial state
and show how the squeeze parameter enters in the generalized uncertainty
relation. Using these results we examine the transition of the system from a
quantum pure state to a nonequilibrium quantum statistical state and to an
equilibrium quantum statistical state. The three stages are marked by the
decoherence time and the relaxation time respectively. With these observations
we explicate the physical conditions when the two basic postulates of quantum
statistical mechanics become valid. We also comment on the inappropriateness in
the usage of the word classicality in many decoherence studies of quantum to
classical transition.

can see the interconnection of some basic quantum statistical processes like
decoherence, dissipation, particle creation, noise and fluctuation. We treat
the case where the Brownian particle is coupled linearly to a bath of time
dependent quadratic oscillators. While the bath mimics a scalar field, the
motion of the Brownian particle modeled by a single oscillator could be used to
depict the behavior of a particle detector, a quantum field mode or the scale
factor of the universe. An important result of this paper is the derivation of
the influence functional encompassing the noise and dissipation kernels in
terms of the Bogolubov coefficients. This method enables one to trace the
source of statistical processes like decoherence and dissipation to vacuum
fluctuations and particle creation, and in turn impart a statistical mechanical
interpretation of quantum field processes. With this result we discuss the
statistical mechanical origin of quantum noise and thermal radiance from black
holes and from uniformly- accelerated observers in Minkowski space as well as
from the de Sitter universe discovered by Hawking, Unruh and Gibbons-Hawking.
We also derive the exact evolution operator and master equation for the reduced
density matrix of the system interacting with a parametric oscillator bath in
an initial squeezed thermal state. These results are useful for decoherence and
backreaction studies for systems and processes of interest in semiclassical
cosmology and gravity. Our model and results are also expected to be useful for

Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF) method, we examine the statistical
mechanical meaning and show the interrelation of the many quantum processes

and dissipation. We show how noise and fluctuation arise naturally from the CTP
formalism. We derive an expression for the CTP effective action in terms of the
Bogolubov coefficients and show how noise is related to the fluctuations in the
number of particles created. In so doing we have extended the old framework of
semiclassical gravity, based on the mean field theory of Einstein equation with
a source given by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor, to that
based on a Langevin-type equation, where the dynamics of fluctuations of
spacetime is driven by the quantum fluctuations of the matter field. This
generalized framework is useful for the investigation of quantum processes in
the early universe involving fluctuations, vacuum stability and phase transtion
phenomena and the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of black holes. It is also
essential to an understanding of the transition from any quantum theory of
gravity to classical general relativity. \pacs{pacs numbers:

static, planar configurations, interpolating between Minkowski space-time and a
new type of space-time with a varying dilaton field. $\alpha=0$ case yields
extreme ``ordinary'' supergravity walls between Minkowski and anti-de Sitter
space-times. For $\alpha=1$ the walls are extreme ``stringy dilatonic'' walls
of the three level superstring vacua interpolating between the constant and
linear dilaton vacuum. Extreme stringy dilatonic walls ($\alpha =1$) serve as a
dividing line between the walls ($0<\alpha<1$) with the (planar) singularity
covered by the horizon and those ($\alpha>1$) with the naked singularity.
Striking similarities between the global space-time structure of such domain
walls and and the one of the corresponding extreme charged black holes with a
general dilaton coupling are pointed out.
