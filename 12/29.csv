nucleosynthesis is presented. The standard code for nucleosynthesis is modified
to allow for a massive decaying tau neutrino whose daughter products include
neutrinos, photons, $e^\pm$ pairs, and/or noninteracting (sterile) daughter
products. Tau-neutrino decays influence primordial nucleosynthesis in three
distinct ways: (i) the energy density of the decaying tau neutrino and its
daughter products affect the expansion rate tending to increase $^4$He, D, and
$^3$He production; (ii) electromagnetic (EM) decay products heat the EM plasma
and dilute the baryon-to-photon ratio tending to decrease $^4$He production and
increase D and $^3$He production; and (iii) electron neutrinos and
antineutrinos produced by tau-neutrino decays increase the weak rates that
govern the neutron-to-proton ratio, leading to decreased $^4$He production for
short lifetimes ($\la 30\sec$) and masses less than about $10\MeV$ and
increased $^4$He production for long lifetimes or large masses. The precise
effect of a decaying tau neutrino on the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis
and the mass-lifetime limits that follow depend crucially upon decay mode. We
identify four generic decay modes that serve to bracket the wider range of
possibilities:

Neutrino inflation is treated both in the diffusive heat transport regime where
neutrinos are optically thick on the length scales of the fluctuations, and in
the homogeneous heating regime where neutrinos are optically thin on these
scales. We find considerable convergence in amplitude evolution for appreciable
ranges in initial fluctuation length scales and amplitudes. Fluctuations

the domain-wall problem does not explicitly arise at the weak scale, but CP
violation still solely originates from a single CP-phase in the vacuum after
spontaneous symmetry breaking. With this phase four types of CP-violating
mechanism are induced in the model. In particular, by a new type of the
mechanism, both the indirect- and direct- CP violation (i.e. $\epsilon$ and
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$) in kaon decay and the neutron electric dipole moment can
be consistently accommodated. The masses of the exotic scalars are weakly
constrained in the model and searching for these particles is worthwhile in the
presently accessible energy range. Substantial CP violation may occur in the
heavy quark and lepton sectors and probing their effects provides a challenge
at B-factory and colliders.
