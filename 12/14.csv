semialgebraic sets in a compact, non singular, real algebraic surface $X$. It
is rather clear that if a semialgebraic set $S$ can be separated from each
connected component of $X\setminus(S\cup\frz S)$ (when $\frz S$ stands for the
Zariski closure of $(\ol S\setminus{\rm Int}(S))\cap{\rm Reg}(X)$), then $S$ is
basic. This leads to associate to $S$ a finite family of sign distributions on
$X\setminus\frz S$; we prove the equivalence between basicness and two
properties of these distributions, which can be tested by an algorithm. There
is a close relation between these two properties and the behaviour of fans in
the algebraic functions field of $X$ associated to a real prime divisor, which
gives an easy proof, for a general surface $X$, of the well known 4-elements
fan's criterion for basicness (Brocker, Andradas-Ruiz). Furthermore, if the
criterion fails, using the description of fans in dimension 2, we find an
algorithmic method to exhibit the failure. Finally, exploiting this thecnics of
sign distribution we give one improvement of the 4-elements fan's criterion of
Brocker to check if a semialgebraic set is principal.

expected to be valid in the linear or quasi linear regime. The moments are
derived for a top--hat window function and for any cosmological parameters
$\Omega$ and $\Lambda$. It turns out that the dependence with $\Lambda$ is
always very weak whereas the moments of the distribution function of the
divergence are strongly dependent on $\Omega$. A method to measure $\Omega$
using the skewness of this field has already been presented by Bernardeau et
al. (1993). I show here that the simultaneous measurement of the skewness and
the kurtosis allows to test the validity of the gravitational instability
scenario hypothesis. Indeed there is a combination of the first three moments
of $\theta$ that is almost independent of the cosmological parameters $\Omega$

classical special functions can be obtained as suitable specializations of
matrix elements or characters of representations of groups. Another rich source
of special functions is the theory of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which
describes the geometric juxtaposition of irreducible components inside the
tensor product of two representations. Finally, in recent works on
representations of (quantum) affine Lie algebras it was shown that matrix
elements of intertwining operators between certain representations of these
algebras are interesting special functions -- (q-)hypergeometric functions and
their generalizations.
  In this paper we suggest a general method of getting special functions from
representation theory which unifies the three methods mentioned above and
allows one to define and study many new special functions. We illustrate this
method by a number of examples -- Macdonald's polynomials, eigenfunctions of

field densities; hence, we also include radiative effects from the background

the presence of the background gauge field to leading order in the perturbative

families. We perform the calculation in a gauge reminiscent of the

The scalar field effective potential is the same in both gauge-fixings and is
independent of the gauge-fixing parameter in the Coulomb family gauge. The
conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken except for two values of the
coupling constant, one of which is the self-dual value. To leading order in the
perturbative expansion, the structure of the classical potential is deeply
distorted by radiative corrections and shows a stable minimum around the

Abstract: Let $\pi$ be the fundamental group of a closed surface and $G$ a Lie
group with a biinvariant metric, not necessarily positive definite. It is shown
that a certain construction due to A. Weinstein relying on techniques from
equivariant cohomology may be refined so as to yield (i) a symplectic structure
on a certain smooth manifold $\Cal M(\Cal P,G)$ containing the space
$\roman{Hom}(\pi,G)$ of homomorphisms and, furthermore, (ii) a hamiltonian
$G$-action on $\Cal M(\Cal P,G)$ preserving the symplectic structure, with
momentum mapping $\mu \colon \Cal M(\Cal P,G) \to g^*$, in such a way that the
reduced space equals the space $\roman{Rep}(\pi,G)$ of representations. Our
approach is somewhat more general in that it also applies to twisted moduli
spaces; in particular, it yields the {\smc Narasimhan-Seshadri} moduli spaces
of semistable holomorphic vector bundles by {\it symplectic reduction in finite
dimensions}.This implies that, when the group $G$ is compact, such a twisted
moduli space inherits a structure of {\it stratified symplectic space}, and
that the strata of these twisted moduli spaces have finite symplectic volume.

this way we avoid the cospicuous fine tuning problem which arises if one gives
instead the couplings of the bare Lagrangian. To show the practical character
of this formulation we deduce the perturbative expansion for the vertex
