non-degenerate subscheme $C$ of ${\bf P}^{g-1}$ over an algebraically closed
field $k$, for which ${\cal O}_C(1) \cong \omega_C$, (the dualizing sheaf)$ and
$h^0(C, {\cal O}_C) = 1$, $h^0(C, \omega_C) = g$. The singularities of $C$ (if
any) are Gorenstein, and $C$ is connected of degree $2g-2$ and arithmetic genus
$g$. In a recent paper, Schreyer has proved that Petri's normalization of the
homogeneous ideal $I(C)$ of a smooth canonically-embedded curve can be also
carried out for singular curves, provided that the curve has a simple
$(g-2)$-secant (a linear ${\bf P}^{g-3}$ intersecting $C$ transversely at
exactly $g-2$ (smooth) points). We use the Petri normalization to study the
Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $2g-2$ and arithmetic genus $g$ in ${\bf
P}^{g-1}$ in the low-genus cases $g = 5,6$. The main results are that the
Hilbert points of all curves for which Petri's approach applies lie on one
irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme in these cases. (The same is not
true for $g$ sufficiently large.)

non-relativistic medium we reduce the description to two structure functions
$S_A(\o)$ and $S_V(\o)$ of the energy transfer, representing the axial-vector
and vector interactions. $S_V$ is well determined by the single-nucleon
approximation while $S_A$ may be dominated by multiply interacting nucleons.
Unless the shape of $S_A(\o)$ changes dramatically at high densities,
scattering processes always dominate over pair processes for neutrino transport
or the emission of right-handed states. Because the emission of right-handed
neutrinos and axions is controlled by the same medium response functions, a
consistent constraint on their properties from consideration of supernova
cooling should use the same structure functions for both neutrino transport and
exotic cooling mechanisms.
