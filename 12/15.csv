sky maps against the hypothesis that the observed temperature fluctuations
reflect Gaussian initial density perturbations with random phases. Recent
papers discuss specific quantities as discriminators between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian behavior, but the treatment of instrumental noise on the data is
largely ignored. The presence of noise in the data biases many statistical
quantities in a manner dependent on both the noise properties and the unknown
CMB temperature field. Appropriate weighting schemes can minimize this effect,
but it cannot be completely eliminated. Analytic expressions are presented for
these biases, and Monte Carlo simulations used to assess the best strategy for
determining cosmologically interesting information from noisy data. The genus
is a robust discriminator that can be used to estimate the power law
quadrupole-normalized amplitude independently of the 2-point correlation
function. The genus of the DMR data are consistent with Gaussian initial
fluctuations with Q_rms = 15.7 +/- 2.2 - (6.6 +/- 0.3)(n - 1) uK where n is the
power law index. Fitting the rms temperature variations at various smoothing
angles gives Q_rms = 13.2 +/- 2.5 uK and n = 1.7 +0.3 -0.6. While consistent
with Gaussian fluctuations, the first year data are only sufficient to rule out
strongly non-Gaussian distributions of fluctuations.

proposed as the relevant low-energy Hamiltonian describing the intrinsic
electronic structure of the CuO$_3$-chains. However, due to charge-spin
decoupling, this model alone cannot reproduce the observed $\sw$. We consider
two additional scattering mechanisms: (i) Disregarding the not so crucial spin
degrees of freedom, the inclusion of strong potential disorder yields excellent
agreement with experiment, but suffers from the unreasonable value of the
disorder strength necessary for the fit. (ii) Moderately strong polaronic
electron-phonon coupling to the mode involving Cu(1)-O(4) stretching, can be
modeled within a 1D Holstein Hamiltonian of spinless fermions. Using a
variational approximation for the phonon Hilbert space, we diagonalize the
Hamiltonian exactly on finite lattices. As a result of the experimental hole
density $\approx 1/2$, the chains can exhibit strong charge-density-wave (CDW)
correlations, driven by phonon-mediated polaron-polaron interactions. In the
vicinity of half filling, charge motion is identified as arising from moving
domain walls, \ie defects in the CDW. Incorporating the effect of vacancy
disorder by choosing open boundary conditions, good agreement with the
experimental spectra is found. In particular, a high-frequency tail arises as a
consequence of the polaron-polaron interactions.

show how one can compute form factors directly in the space of fields. This
introduces the notion of vertex operators, and form factors are vacuum
expectation values of such vertex operators in the space of fields. The vertex
operators can be constructed explicitly in radial quantization. Furthermore,
these vertex operators can be exactly bosonized in momentum space. We develop
these ideas by studying the free-fermion point of the sine-Gordon theory, and
use this scheme to compute some form-factors of some non-free fields in the
sine-Gordon theory. This work further clarifies earlier work of one of the
authors, and extends it to include the periodic sector.
