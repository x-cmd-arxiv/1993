the case of maps from P^m to a smooth toric variety, we get an especially

even if the noise level is negligible when the four year COBE data are

the Gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations. This important issue is
addressed here by studying the angular bispectrum of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. A general form of the angular bispectrum is given and
the cosmic variance of the angular bispectrum for Gaussian fluctuations is
calculated. The advantage of using the angular bispectrum is that one can
choose to use the multipole moments which minimize the cosmic variance term.
The non-Gaussian signals in most physically motivated non-Gaussian models are
small compared with cosmic variance. Unless the amplitudes are large, the
non-Gaussian signals are only detectable in the COBE data in those models where
the angular bispectrum is flat or increases with increasing multipole moment.

under such general conditions, the lowest Landau level, the ground state,
remains degenerate. Previous discussions of this problem have had less

  The mathematical similarity of the physical problem at hand and that of a

emphasized. Adopting this analogy in the general case leads to a general
quantization procedure that is invariant under general coordinate
transformations-- completely unlike any of the conventional quantization
prescriptions -- and therefore generalizes the concept of quantization to new
and hitherto inaccesible situations.
  In a complementary fashion , the so-obtained picture of general quantization
helps to derive useful semiclassical formulas for the Hall current in the case

model I investigate the possibility of resolving the strong CP puzzle by a
highly suppressed up quark mass. In some scenarios the up quark mass may be as
small as $10^{-8}MeV$. I show that in the specific model the suppression of the
up quark mass is incompatible with the requirement of a nonvanishing electron
mass. I discuss how this situation may be remedied.

transition. A CP-asymmetry is found in the reflection coefficients of quarks

problem is analyzed both in an academic zero temperature case and in the
realistic finite temperature one. The building blocks are similar in both
cases: Kobayashi-Maskawa CP-violation, CP-even phases in the reflection
coefficients of quarks, and physical transitions due to fermion self-energies.
In both cases an effect is present at order $\alpha_W^2$ in rate. A standard
GIM behaviour is found as intuitively expected. In the finite temperature case,
a crucial role is played by the damping rate of quasi-particles in a hot
plasma, which is a relevant scale together with $M_W$ and the temperature. The
effect is many orders of magnitude below what observation requires, and
indicates that non standard physics is indeed needed in the cosmological
