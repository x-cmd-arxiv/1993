odd-parity deformations. We demonstrate that they are uniquely classified in
terms of their odd and even-parity pure gauge field behaviour at spatial
infinity. Fermion level crossing occurs only for odd-parity configurations
which are topologically disconnected from the vacuum. They contribute to the
high temperature unsuppressed baryon violating thermal transitions.
Deformations with even-parity pure gauge behaviour at spatial infinity are
topologically trivial and do not mediate baryon number violation in the early
Universe.

A9 (1994) 1529-1544","10.1142/S0217732394001374",,"hep-ph",,"  Due to the presence of the chiral anomaly sphalerons with Chern-Simons number
a half (CS=1/2) are the only static configurations that allow for a fermion
level crossing in the two-dimensional Abelian-Higgs model with massless
fermions, i.e. in the absence of Yukawa interactions. In the presence of
fermion-Higgs interactions we demonstrate the existence of zero energy
solutions to the one-dimensional Dirac equation at deformed sphalerons with
CS$\neq 1/2 .$ Induced level crossing due to Yukawa interactions illustrates a
non-trivial generalization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and of the
equivalence between parity anomaly in odd and the chiral anomaly in even
dimensions. We discuss a subtle manifestation of this effect in the standard
electroweak theory at finite temperatures.
