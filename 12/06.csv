$\epsilon$-expansion. This expansion, based on dimensional continuation from 3
to $4{-}\epsilon$ spatial dimensions, provides a systematic approximation for
computing the effects of (near)-critical fluctuations. The $\epsilon$-expansion
is known to predict a first-order transition in Higgs theories, even for heavy
Higgs boson masses. The validity of this conclusion in the standard model is
examined in detail. A variety of physical quantities are computed at leading
and next-to-leading order in $\epsilon$. For moderately light Higgs masses
(below 100~GeV), the $\epsilon$-expansion suggests that the transition is more
strongly first order than is predicted by the conventional analysis based on
the one-loop (ring-improved) effective potential. Nevertheless, the rate of
baryon non-conservation after the transition is found to be {\em larger\/} than
that given by the one-loop effective potential calculation. Detailed
next-to-leading order calculations of some sample quantities suggests that the
$\eps$-expansion is reasonably well behaved for Higgs masses below 100--200

the number of scalar fields) and find that the $\eps$-expansion is less well

quarks and leptons by means of the universal seesaw mechanism. The obtained
mass matrices are simply parametrized by two small coefficients which can be
given by the ratio of the GUT and superstring compactification scales. The
model allows a natural (without fine tuning) doublet-triplet splitting. It has
a strong predictive power, though no special texture is utilized in contrast to
the known predictive frameworks. Namely, the model implies that $m_b=4-5$ GeV,
$m_s=100-150$ MeV, $m_u/m_d=0.5-0.7$ and $\tan\beta<1.1$. The Top quark is
naturally in the 100 GeV range, but not too heavy: $m_t<150$ GeV. All CKM
mixing angles are in correct range. The Higgsino mediated $d=5$ operators for
