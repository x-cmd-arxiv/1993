scale structure, the cmb anisotropy and inflation. In some places a basic
familiarity with particle physics is assumed, but otherwise no special
knowledge is needed. Most of the material in the first two sections can be
found in several texts, except that the discussion of dark matter and the
cosmological constant is more up to date. Most of that in the remaining
sections can be found in a review of structure formation and inflation done
with Andrew Liddle, which describes original work by various authors including
ourselves and Ewan Stewart. The reader is referred to these works for more
detail, and a very complete list of references.

"cond-mat/9312047","Wenbin Yu","Wenbin and David G. Stroud","Vortex Motion and Vortex Friction Coefficient in Triangular Josephson
  Junction Arrays","12 pages + 14 figures, REVTeX 3.0, will be published in Phys. Rev. B",,,,"cond-mat",,"  The dynamical response of triangular JJA is investigated using the RCSJ
model. A flux flow regime is found to extend between a lower vortex-depinning
current and a higher critical current, in agreement with previous calculations
for square arrays. In the flux flow regime, the dynamical response to the bias
current is roughly Ohmic, and the time-dependent voltage can be well understood
in terms of vortex degrees of freedom. The vortex friction coefficient $\eta$
depends strongly on the McCumber-Stewart parameter $\beta$, and at large
$\beta$ is approximately independent of the shunt resistance $R$. To account
for this, we generalize a model of Geigenm\""{u}ller {\it et al} to treat energy
loss from moving vortices to the phase analog of optical spin waves in a
triangular lattice. The value of $\eta$ at all values of $\beta$ agrees quite
well with this model in the low-density limit. The vortex depinning current is
estimated as $0.042I_c$, independent of the direction of applied current, in
agreement with static calculations by Lobb {\it et al}. A simple argument
suggests that quantum effects in vortex motion may become important when the
flux flow resistivity is of order $h/(2e)^2$ per unit frustration.

very weak Yukawa couplings in a generic standard--like superstring model.
Leptoquark--(down--like) quark mixing though present, is not large enough to
violate the unitarity bounds on the CKM matrix. The constraints on leptoquark
masses and couplings from FCNCs are easily satisfied whereas those from baryon
number violation may cause problems. The leptoquarks of the model are compared
to the ones in $E_6$ Calabi--Yau and flipped $SU(5) \times U(1)$ models.

framework of the theory of vector bundles on Riemann surfaces of genus greater
than one. We point out how Toda fields can be considered as equivalent to Higgs
systems -- a connection on a vector bundle $E$ together with an
End($E$)--valued one form both in the standard and in the Conformal Affine
case. We discuss how variations of Hodge structures can arise in such a
framework and determine holomorphic embeddings of Riemann surfaces into locally
homogeneous spaces, thus giving hints to possible realizations of
$W_n$--geometries. }
