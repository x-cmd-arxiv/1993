can account for the image arrangement and approximately for the relative

secondary mass concentration were predicted and subsequently luminous galaxies
were found at these locations. This argues against the existence of substantial
numbers of ``dark'' galaxies. The model suggests that if the compact radio
source is intrinsically superluminal then the observed component motions may be
as large as ~100c with image B moving in the opposite direction to images A and
C. The prospects for a measuring the Hubble constant from a model incorporating
lens galaxy locations, compact radio source expansion speeds and radio time

restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion
statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular
case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction
services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a
sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge

with any projection tensor field on a manifold with any affine connection. The
approaches to projection tensor fields which have been used in general
relativity and related theories assume normal projection tensors of

These assumptions fail for projections onto lightlike curves or surfaces and
other situations where degenerate metrics occur as well as projections onto
two-surfaces and projections onto spacetime in the higher dimensional manifolds
of unified field theories. This paper removes these restrictive assumptions.
One key idea is to define two different ''extrinsic curvature tensors'' which
become equal for normal projections. In addition, a new family of geometrical
tensors is introduced: the cross-projected curvature tensors. In terms of these
objects, projection decompositions of covariant derivatives, the full Riemann
curvature tensor and the Bianchi identities are obtained and applied to perfect

charmonium is given with the use of a nonsingular potential model for heavy
quarkonia. We also show that the recently observed mass difference between the
center of gravity of the ${}^3P_J$ states and the ${}^1P_1$ state of $c\bar{c}$
does not provide a direct test of the color hyperfine interaction in heavy
quarkonia. Our theoretical value for the mass of the ${}^1P_1$ state is in
agreement with the experimental result, and its E1 transition width is
341.8~keV. The mass of the $\eta_c'$ state is predicted to be 3622.3~MeV.

Mackey's approach to quantisation on homogeneous spaces. We recall the
bicrossproduct models of the author, which generalise the quantum double. We
describe the general extension theory of Hopf algebras and the nonAbelian
cohomology spaces $\CH^2(H,A)$ which classify them. They form a new kind of
topological quantum number in physics which is visible only in the quantum
world. These same cross product quantisations can also be viewed as trivial
quantum principal bundles in quantum group gauge theory. We also relate this
nonAbelian cohomology $\CH^2(H,\C )$ to Drinfeld's theory of twisting.

possible topological obstructions. Being inherited from the group metric it is
