high-symmetry geometries are studied using the discrete-variational
local-spin-density-functional method. The ground state is found to be the
icosahedral structure, and a total magnetic moment of 15$\mu_B$ is obtained for
the cluster. This value is anomalously smaller than those for clusters with
lower symmetries, but in agreement with recent experiments. The magnetic
interactions between the central and surface atoms of the cluster are {\it not}
fully ferromagnetic, and a small amount of antiferromagnetic interactions is
found to be mixed in. An energy parameter is introduced to explain the
anomalous magnetic properties, which is found to be also useful for judging
whether some techniques can or must be used in the
local-spin-density-functional calculations.

radiative modification of the Coulomb interaction between the $\tau$ leptons.
The interpolation between the Coulomb effects at the threshold and the

radiative corrections (involving these scalars) to the branching ratio
$R_b=\Gamma (Z\rightarrow b\bar b)/\Gamma (Z\rightarrow {\rm hadrons})$ are
negative and thus place a stringent lower bound on the masses of the colored
scalars. This turns out to be $\sim 400$ GeV with $m_t=150$ GeV and increases
quadratically with $m_t$. It is emphasized that $R_b$ is a parameter that is
well-determined experimentally and that theoretical estimates are relatively
free from uncertainties emanating from hadronic corrections and are
comparatively insensitive to the value of the top mass.

can be always represented as an expansion over characters of $GL$ group. The
integration over ""matter fields"" can be interpreted as going over the {\it
model} (the space of all highest weight representations) of $GL$. In the case
of compact unitary groups the integrals should be substituted by {\it discrete}
sums over weight lattice. The $D=0$ version of the model is the Generalized
Kontsevich integral, which in the above-mentioned unitary (discrete) situation
coincides with partition function of the $2d$ Yang-Mills theory with the target
space of genus $g=0$ and $m=0,1,2$ holes. This particular quantity is always a
bilinear combination of characters and appears to be a Toda-lattice
$\tau$-function. (This is generalization of the classical statement that
individual $GL$ characters are always singular KP $\tau$-functions.) The
corresponding element of the Universal Grassmannian is very simple and somewhat
similar to the one, arising in investigations of the $c=1$ string models.
However, under certain circumstances the formal sum over representations should
be evaluated by steepest descent method and this procedure leads to some more
complicated elements of Grassmannian. This ""Kontsevich phase"" as opposed to the
simple ""character phase"" deserves further investigation.
