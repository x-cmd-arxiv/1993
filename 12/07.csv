quantum noise and fluctuations play an active role such as particle creation,
galaxy formation and entropy generation. Using the influence functional we
first explain the origin and nature of noise in quantum systems interacting
with an environment at a finite temperature. With linear coupling to nonohmic
baths or at low temperatures, colored noise and nonlocal dissipation would
appear and for nonlinear coupling multiplicative noise is generally expected.
We derive a generalized fluctuation- dissipation relation for these systems.
Then using a model of quantum Brownian motion in a bath of parametric
oscillators, we show how noise and dissipation can be related to the Bogolubov
coefficients of parametric amplification, which in the second-quantized sense,
depicts cosmological particle creation in a dynamic background. We then
calculate the influence functional and study the noise characteristics of
quantum fields as probed by a particle detector. As examples, we show that an
uniformly- accelerated observer in flat space or an inertial observer in an
exponentially expanding (de Sitter) universe would see a thermal particle
spectrum, recovering the well-known results of Unruh and Gibbons and Hawking ,
as inspired by the Hawking effect in black holes. We show how this method can
be effectively used for treating the backreaction of particle creation and

the solutions of a non-linear integral equation. Whether the wave function is
extended or localized, for example, corresponds to whether or not the equation
has a complex solution. We show how the equation can be solved in a weak
disorder expansion. We find that, for small disorder strength $\lambda$, there
is an energy $E_c(\lambda )$ above which the density of states and the
conducting properties vanish to all orders in perturbation theory. We compute
perturbatively the position of the line $E_c(\lambda )$ which begins, in the
limit of zero disorder, at the band edge of the pure system. Inside the band of
the pure system the density of states and conducting properties can be computed
perturbatively. This expansion breaks down near $E_c(\lambda )$ because of
small denominators. We show how it can be resummed by choosing the appropriate
scaling of the energy. For energies greater than $E_c(\lambda )$ we show that
non-perturbative effects contribute to the density of states but have been
unable tell whether they also contribute to the conducting properties.

present in this note a completely explicit computation of the diagrams

for a meaningful estimate of the matrix elements. We find that these matrix
elements are typically twice as large as previous estimates. However, inserting
these new estimates into the recently corrected expressions for the first
moments of $g_1$ leads to corrections too small to affect the phenomenological

corresponding hierarchy. We work out two examples: the $sl(2)/U(1)$ coset,
leading to the Non-Linear Schr\""{o}dinger hierarchy, and the $U(1)$ coset of
the Polyakov-Bershadsky $\cw$ algebra, leading to a $3$-field representation of
the KP hierarchy already encountered in the literature. In such examples a
rational algebra appears as algebra of constraints when reducing a KP hierarchy
to a finite field representation. This fact arises the natural question whether
rational algebras are always associated to such reductions and whether a
classification of rational algebras can lead to a classification of the
integrable hierarchies.

to point out the existence of a second class of deformable W-algebras, which in

examples of coset constructions, orbifold projections, as well as first class
Hamiltonian reductions of DS type W-algebras leading to reduced algebras with
such infinitely generated classical limit. We also show in examples that the
reduced quantum algebras are finitely generated due to quantum corrections
arising upon normal ordering the relations obeyed by the classical generators.
We apply invariant theory to describe the relations and to argue that classical
cosets are infinitely, nonfreely generated in general. As a by-product, we also
explain the origin of the previously constructed and so far unexplained
deformable quantum W(2,4,6) and W(2,3,4,5) algebras.

different behavior in asymptotically free and non--asymptotically free

asymptotically free to the non--asymptotically free) takes place via a
continuous phase transition. For asymptotically free theories there exist
regimes where the ``temperatures"" are negative. In asymptotically free theories
there exist maser--like states mostly in the infrared; furthermore, as one goes
into the ultraviolet and more matter states contribute to quantum processes,
the quantum field system can shed entropy and cause the formation of
thermodynamically stable {\it entropy--ordered} states. It is shown how the
known heavier quarks can be thus described.

consequence of the $\W$-algebra realizations that have been chosen. In this
note we point out a whole new class of possible $\W$-strings built from
representations of affine Lie algebras via (quantum) Drinfel'd-Sokolov
reduction. Explicitly, we construct a BRST operator in terms of
$\widehat{sl}_3$ currents which computes the physical spectrum of a
$\W_3$-string. As a special case of this construction, if we take a free-field
realization of $\widehat{sl}_3$, we recover the 2-scalar $\W_3$-string. These
results generalize to any $\W$-algebra which can be obtained via quantum
Drinfel'd-Sokolov reduction from an affine algebra.
