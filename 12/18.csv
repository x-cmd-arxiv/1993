used for a far wider range of gravitational instability scenarios than formerly
proposed; we study here how to extend this range. In previous work we studied
the accuracy of several analytic approximations to gravitational clustering in
the mildly nonlinear regime. We found that the ``truncated Zel'dovich
approximation"" (TZA) was better than any other (except in one case the ordinary
Zeldovich approximation) over a wide range from linear to mildly nonlinear
($\sigma \sim 3$) regimes. TZA sets Fourier amplitudes equal to zero for {\it
all} wavenumbers greater than $k_{n\ell}$, where $k_{n\ell}$ marks the
transition to the nonlinear regime. Here, we study crosscorrelation of
generalized TZA with a group of $n$--body simulations for three shapes of
window function: sharp $k$--truncation (as in CMS), tophat in coordinate space,
or a Gaussian. We also study the crosscorrelation as a function of initial
scale within each window type. We find $k$--truncation, which was so much
better than other things tried in CMS, is the {it worst} of these three window
shapes. We find that a Gaussian window $e^{-k^2/2k_G^2}$ applied to the intial
Fourier amplitudes is the best choice. It produces a greatly improved
crosscorrelation all cases we studied. The optimum choice of $k_G$ for the
Gaussian window is (spectrum-- dependent) 1--1.5 times $k_{n\ell}$, with
$k_{n\ell}$ defined by (3). Although all three windows produce similar power
spectra and density distribution functions after application of the Zeldovich
approximation, phase agreement with the $n$--body simulation is better for the
Gaussian window. We ascribe Gaussian window success to its superior treatment
of phase evolution.

emission spectra with no clear upper energy cutoff. AGN, considered to be
possible sources for the highest energy cosmic rays, may have emission
extending well into the VHE (very high energy, E>100 GeV) domain. Because VHE
gamma-rays are absorbed by pair production on the intergalactic background
radiation, much of this emission is not visible. Electromagnetic cascades
initiated by absorbed VHE gamma-rays, however, may be observable. Since the
velocities of e+e- pairs produced in a cascade are likely to be isotropized by
an ambient random magnetic field, extended ``halos'' (R>1 Mpc) of pairs will be
formed around AGN with VHE emission. Cascade radiation from these pair halos is
emitted isotropically and is observable below a few TeV. The halo radiation can
be distinguished by its characteristic variation in spectrum and intensity with
angular distance from the central source. This variation depends weakly on the
details of the central source model, e.g., the orientation and beaming/opening
angle of an emitting jet. Limiting or determining the intensity of the pair
halo can thus serve as a model-independent bound on or measure of the VHE power
of AGN. Next-generation Cherenkov telescopes may be able to image a pair halo.

presence of a metallic gate parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron

``filling'' of the Coulomb gap in the density of localized states. At low
enough temperatures this leads to a substantial enhancement and a new
temperature behavior of the hopping conductivity. As a result, the diagonal
conductivity peaks become much wider. The power law dependence of the width of
the peaks on the temperature changes: the corresponding exponent turns out to
be twice as small as that for gateless structures. The width dependences on the
current in non-ohmic regime and on the frequency for the absorption of the
electromagnetic waves experience a similar modification. The experimental
observation of the crossovers predicted may demonstrate the important role of
the Coulomb interaction in the integer quantum Hall regime.

technicolor models, the technicolor scale is generally smaller than the
electroweak scale, and the entire technicolor spectrum is shifted to lower
energies. In addition, the technifermions can develop large `current' masses
from the scalar's vev, so that the technicolor spectrum does not necessarily
look like a scaled-up version of ordinary QCD. We discuss the collider
signatures for the technirho in these models in the limit that the technirho is
light. Although we focus mostly on the production and detection of the
technirho in hadron colliders, we also discuss a peculiar limit in which the
technirho may be light enough to be seen at LEP II.

exact derivation of lattice global Ward identities. We then check that the
proper algebraic relations are obeyed in the scaling limit. The latter is under
reasonable control thanks to the Bethe-ansatz solution. The results, which are
mostly numerical for technical reasons, are remarkably precise. They are also
corroborated by exact pieces of information from various sources, in particular
Temperley-Lieb algebra representation theory. Most features of the Virasoro
algebra (like central term, null vectors, metric properties...) can thus be
observed using the lattice models. This seems of general interest for lattice
