galaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and
defining the so-called ``fundamental plane"". In this {\em Letter} we present
observational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour.
Assuming a relation $L \propto R^{\alpha}\sigma^{2 \beta}$, the best-fit values
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The
dispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly
smaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\sigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We
briefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of
objects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters.

applying the renormalization group techniques from critical phenomena to the
scaling limit of matrix models in two-dimensional quantum gravity. They
endeavor to get the lowest order fixed points of the theory giving insight upon
the critical points of the theory. We show that at leading order the
perturbative result is equal to the saddle-point approximation result. We
calculate the next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion exploring the
goodness of the approach.

studied at the quasi-elastic peak in the standard theory with emphasis on the
effect of nucleonic and pionic relativistic corrections. The cases of polarized
beam or/and polarized target are considered. Sizeable relativistic effects are
pointed out in several polarization components. The sensitivity of nucleon
polarization to the neutron charge form factor $G_E^n$ is discussed. In
particular, it is shown that the longitudinal component of neutron polarization
with vector polarized deuterons is as sensitive to $G_E^n$ as the sideways beam
polarization transfer.

features of self-organized criticality (SOC), i.e., power law behaviour of
correlations in space and 1/f-noise, as a consequence of considering random
peptide group displacements from their (periodic) equilibrium positions along a
chain. This may shed light on a basic mechanism leading to obtain flicker noise
in alpha-helix protein chains and to predict a SOC regime in biomolecular
structures from first principles. We believe our treatment of 1/f noise to be
of some relevance to recent findings due to Voss on DNA [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68,
3805 (1992)].
