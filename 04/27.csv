\tsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic

\tsmctlmc\ $\sim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic

then the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two.

principle arises in formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the decoherent
histories approach, whose central goal is the assignment of probabilities to
histories. We first consider histories characterized by position or momentum
projections at two moments of time. Both exact and approximate (Gaussian)
projections are studied. Shannon information is used as a measure of the
uncertainty expressed in the probabilities for these histories. We derive a
number of inequalities in which the uncertainty principle is expressed as a
lower bound on the information of phase space distributions derived from the
probabilities for two-time histories. We go on to consider histories
characterized by position samplings at $n$ moments of time. We derive a lower
bound on the information of the joint probability for $n$ position samplings.
Similar bounds are derived for histories characterized by samplings of other
variables. All lower bounds on the information of histories have the general
form $\ln \left( V_H / V_S \right) $, where $V_H$ is a volume element of
history space, which we define, and $V_S$ is the volume of that space probed by
the projections. We thus obtain a concise and general form of the uncertainty
principle referring directly to the histories description of the system, and
making no reference to notions of phase space.

potential predicts the $pp$ data accurately, while the $np$ version of that
same potential is poor in $np$ (where also the T=0 potential is involved). An
example for this is the Nijmegen potential, which predicts the $pp$ data well
with a $\chi^2$/datum of 2.0, but yields a $\chi^2$/datum of 6.5 in $np$.

mesons the positive energy states as well as the negative energy states are
included. Using relativistic quasi-potential equations the contribution of the
negative energy states is studied for the light and charmonium mesons. It is
found that these states change the meson mass spectrum significantly but leave
its global structure untouched.

Lipkin-Nogami method. The accuracy of the method is tested for the
Krumlinde-Szyma\'nski R(5) model. The results of calculations are compared with
those obtained from the standard mean field theory and particle-number
projection method, and with exact solutions.
