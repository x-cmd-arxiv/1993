  bibliography and a revised title. A brief note is added to point out a

particles we point to the existence of certain inherent tachyonic dispersion
relations: E^2= p^2-m^2. We put forward an interpretation that exploits these
``negative mass squared'' solutions; rotational invariance is spontaneously
broken. Relevance of these results to the vortices in the cosmos is pointed
out.
  NOTE: Just as ""negative energy solutions'' of Dirac equation are
re-interpreted as antiparticles, similarly the possibility exists for
re-interpreting the tachyonic dispersion relations of all (j,0)+(0,j)
representation spaces via spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In Mod. Phys.
Lett. A8:2623-2630,1993 we exhibited this explicitly for the j=1 representation
space. The interest in this old subject has grown markedly in recent years as
is evident from numerous theoretical and phenomenological works on the subject.
With this observation, we make this replacement of our paper fourteen years
after its initial publication. The Abstract and main text remain unaltered. The
title is changed to reflect the underlying physics more closely.

COMMENTS,
FOR THE RECORD: A referees reoprt from Phys. Rev. Lett. read in part ``The
first named author has appreciated my exceptionally long report. He has read
and well assimilated the literature I suggested. Congratulations! This very new
version of the manuscript has now three authors and carries a very well chosen
title. Indeed Bargmann, Wightman and Wigner had studied, this subject forty
years ago, in an unpublished book (several chapters were distributed as
preprints). The authors explain well the scope of their paper. They have made a
thorough construction of a field theory of a non usual Wigner type; that is
completely new and all references are relevant. {\it This paper should be
published.}"" Despite the fact that no other report was received, the editors of
Phys. Rev. Lett. rejected this paper.

of the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. Quantum duality principle describes
relations between a Hopf algebra, its dual, and their Heisenberg double in a
way which extends both the theory of coadjoint orbits and the classical Fourier
transform. We also describe the twisted Heisenberg double which is relevant for
the study of nontrivial deformations of the quantized universal enveloping
algebras.

(2D) Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian supplemented by a kinetic term for the coframe
and a translational {\it boundary} term. The resulting model is equivalent to a
Yang-Mills theory of local {\it translations} and frozen Lorentz gauge degrees.
We will show that this restricted Poincar\'e gauge model in 2 dimensions is
completely integrable. {\it Exact} wave, charged black hole, and `dilaton'
solutions are then readily found. In vacuum, the integrability of the {\it
general} 2D Poincar\'e gauge theory is formally proved along the same line of
reasoning.
