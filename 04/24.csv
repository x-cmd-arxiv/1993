interactions in the presence of a magnetic field which breaks single particle
degeneracies. The conductance at zero temperature as a function of the Fermi
energy in the leads consists of a set of peaks related to changing by one the
electron occupancy in the box. We find that the position and heights of the
peaks are controlled by many-body effects. We compute the conductance up to 8
electrons for several cases where correlation effects dominate. In the range of
intermediate fields spin selection rules quench some peaks. At low and high
fields the behavior of the conductance as a function of the number of electrons
is very different due to big changes in the many-body ground state
wavefunctions.

It is shown that 1) the impurity bond brings about a massive triplet mode in
the Haldane gap, 2) the triplet state comprises three of the four ground states
of an open chain, 3) the excited states with the domain wall trapped at the
impurity bond, including the massive triplet mode, exhibit a N\'eel-type

triviality of the scalar symmetry-breaking sector. If the Higgs mass is
approximately 600 GeV or higher, there must be additional dynamics at a scale
$\Lambda$ which is less than a few TeV. In this case the properties of the
Higgs resonance can differ substantially from those predicted by the standard
model. In this letter we construct an effective Lagrangian description of a
theory with a non-standard Higgs boson and analyze the features of a theory
with such a resonance coupled to the Goldstone Bosons of the breaking of $\su$.
This Lagrangian describes the most general theory in which the Higgs and the
Goldstone Bosons are the only particles with a mass small compared to
$\Lambda$. We compute the leading corrections to the decay width of the Higgs
boson and the contribution to the Peskin-Takeuchi parameter $S$ and present
results for the corrections to Goldstone Boson scattering. We find that the
most prominent effects are due to one new parameter, which is directly related
to the Higgs boson width.

Schatten class of rank $2p=4$ which contains $(3+1)$-dimensional analog of the
loop groups and is closely related to Yang-Mills theory with fermions in

weight'' representation of this group found by Mickelsson and Rajeev. Our
approach is close to quantum field theory, with the elements of this group
regarded as Bogoliubov transformations for fermions in an external Yang-Mills
field. Though these cannot be unitarily implemented in the physically relevant
representation of the fermion field algebra, we argue that they can be
implemented by sesquilinear forms, and that there is a (regularized) product of
forms providing an appropriate group structure. On the Lie algebra level, this
gives an explicit, non-perturbative construction of fermion current algebras in
$(3+1)$ space-time dimensions which explicitly shows that the ``wave function
renormalization'' required for a consistent definition of the currents and
their Lie bracket naturally leads to the Schwinger term identical with the
Mickelsson-Rajeev cocycle. Though the explicit form of the Schwinger term is
given only for the case $p=2$, our arguments apply also to the restricted
linear groups modeled by Schatten classes of rank $2p=6,8,\ldots$ corresponding
to current algebras in $(d+1)$- dimensions, $d=5,7,\ldots$.
