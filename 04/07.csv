and CO$(2.3\mu )$. These data are used to establish whether K-band ($2.2\mu$)
images of spiral galaxies provide reliable maps of stellar surface mass density
features such as massive spiral arms or bars. The main distorting agents in the
mapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars.
From modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find that
the K-band flux is attenuated by only $\ltorder 10\%$ even in the dust lanes.
From monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO$(2.3\mu )$ index across the spiral
arms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the
K-band image except in one small patch. On this basis, {\it we conclude that K
band images do trace the massive disk star population}. In M51 we find the
surface mass density contrast (arm/inter-arm) to range from 1.8 to 3,
comparable to results from N-body simulations of the galaxy's tidal encounter
with NGC~5195. The spiral arm amplitude in M51 also shows smooth, strong radial
variations, with a maximum at $\sim 130\asec$ and minima at $45\asec$ and
$170\asec$.

main result is that the cluster algorithms become more efficient when the

which a classical metric is coupled to the expectation value of the stress
tensor. It is argued that this theory is a good approximation only when the
fluctuations in the stress tensor are small. We calculate a dimensionless
measure of these fluctuations for a scalar field on a flat background in
particular cases, including squeezed states and the Casimir vacuum state. It is
found that the fluctuations are small for states which are close to a coherent
state, which describes classical behavior, but tend to be large otherwise. We
find in all cases studied that the energy density fluctuations are large
whenever the local energy density is negative. This is taken to mean that the
gravitational field of a system with negative energy density, such as the
Casimir vacuum, is not described by a fixed classical metric but is undergoing
large metric fluctuations. We propose an operational scheme by which one can
describe a fluctuating gravitational field in terms of the statistical behavior
of test particles. For this purpose we obtain an equation of the form of the
Langevin equation used to describe Brownian motion.

accompanied by and mix with heavy $SU(2)_\L \times SU(2)_\R$ singlet partners.
The resulting fermion mass matrices are seesaw in form. Discrete parity
symmetries render the determinants of these mass matrices real and eliminate CP
violating gauge terms. The unified seesaw models consequently provide a
possible resolution to the strong CP problem. Secondly, $\sinsq$ at the
unification scale is numerically smaller than the experimentally measured $Z$
scale value. The weak angle must therefore increase as it evolves down in
energy. Finally, proton decay is suppressed by small seesaw mixing factors in
all these theories.
