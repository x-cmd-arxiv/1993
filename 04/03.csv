1991 has revealed dramatic, large-amplitude, rapid variations in the
ultraviolet flux of this BL Lac object. Many smaller, rapid flares are
superimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period
when sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent
quasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and
long-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other,
and with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on
IUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the
sense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet
spectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between
spectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is
associated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1
day. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration
processes expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are
consistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for
quasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models
are stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability.

well by a simple argument due to Flory. By considering oriented polymers living
in a one-parameter family of background tangent fields, we are able to relate
the wandering exponent to the exponent in the background field through an
$\epsilon$-expansion. We then choose the background field to have the same
correlations as the individual polymer, thus self-consistently solving for
$\nu$. We find $\nu=3/(d+2)$ for $d<4$ and $\nu=1/2$ for $d\ge 4$, which is
exactly the Flory result.

means of already (or shortly to be) available technology, independently of
current efforts of detection. The present is a follow-up on a recently
suggested detection strategy based on gravity-wave-induced deviations of null
geodesics. The new development is that a way was found to probe the waves close
to the source, where they are several orders of magnitude larger than on the
Earth. The effect translates into apparent shifts in stellar angular positions
that could be as high as $10^{-7}$ arcsec, which is just about the present
theoretical limit of detectability. (Calculation improved; results unchanged.)

up to maximal even if the Dirac mass matrices of leptons have structure similar

found. The first one includes the see-saw generation of heavy Majorana masses
for right-handed neutrinos and a universality of
  Yukawa couplings which can follow from the unification of neutrinos with new
superheavy neutral leptons. The second set is related to lepton number symmetry
of the Yukawa interactions in the Dirac basis of neutrinos. Models which
realize these conditions have strong hierarchy or strong degeneration of
Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos.

particle in two dimensions subject to a periodic potential, uniform magnetic
field, and dissipative force. Its phase diagram exhibits an SL(2,Z) duality
symmetry and has an infinite number of critical circles in the
dissipation/magnetic field plane. In addition, multi-critical points on a
particular critical circle correspond to non-trivial solutions of open string
theory. The duality symmetry is expected to provide relations between
correlation functions at different multi-critical points. Many of these
correlators are contact terms. However we expect them to have physical
significance because under duality they transform into functions that are
non-zero for large separations of the operators. Motivated by the search for
exact, regulator independent solutions for these contact terms, in this paper
we derive many properties and symmetries of the coordinate correlation
functions at the special multi-critical points. In particular, we prove that
the correlation functions are homogeneous, piecewise-linear functions of the
momenta, and we prove a weaker version of the anticipated duality
transformation. Consequently, the possible forms of the correlation functions
are limited to lie in a finite dimensional linear space. We treat the potential
perturbatively and these results are valid to all orders in perturbation
theory.
