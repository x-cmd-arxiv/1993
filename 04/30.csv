observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these
characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in
hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial
ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very
satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main
perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of
clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a
distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the
proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects
involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the
saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium
is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all
clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large
scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when
estimating the virial mass of clusters.

to find a framework for quantization which provides a {\em general}

algebraic formulation of the Dirac approach to the quantization of constrained
systems, due to A. Ashtekar. The Dirac quantization program is augmented by a
general principle to find the inner product on physical states. Essentially,
the Hermiticity conditions on physical operators determine this inner product.
I also clarify the role in quantum theory of possible algebraic identities
between the elementary variables. I use this approach to quantize various
finite dimensional systems. Some of these models test the new aspects of the
algebraic framework. Others bear qualitative similarities to \gr, and may give
some insight into the pitfalls lurking in \qg. In (spatially compact) general
relativity, the Hamiltonian is constrained to vanish. I present various
approaches one can take to obtain an interpretation of the quantum theory of
such ``dynamically constrained'' systems. I apply some of these ideas to the
Bianchi I cosmology, and analyze the issue of the initial singularity in
quantum theory.

multi-component non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this case we can have a
second Hamiltonian bracket structure which violates Jacobi identity. We

by restricting gauge transformation between corresponding two-boson

antisymmetric tensor fields by introducing a new potential whose curl gives the
dual field strength, thereby interchanging field equations with Bianchi
identities. We describe a general procedure for constructing actions containing
both potentials at the same time, such that the dual relationship of the field
strengths arises as an equation of motion. The price for doing this is the
sacrifice of manifest Lorentz invariance or general coordinate invariance,
though both symmetries can be realized nonetheless. There are various examples
of global symmetries that have been realized as symmetries of field equations
but not actions. These can be elevated to symmetries of the action by our
method. The main example that we focus on is the low-energy effective action
description of the heterotic string theory compactified on a six-torus to four
dimensions. We show that the SL(2,R) symmetry, whose SL(2,Z) subgroup has been
conjectured to be an exact symmetry of the full string theory, can be realized
on the action in a way that brings out a remarkable similarity to the target
space duality symmetry O(6,22). Our analysis indicates that SL(2,Z) symmetry
may arise naturally in a dual formulation of the theory.
