""Gravitation and Quantizations"". They develop a generalized sum-over-histories
quantum mechanics for quantum cosmology that does not require either a
preferred notion of time or a definition of measurement. The ""post-Everett""
quantum mechanics of closed systems is reviewed. Generalized quantum theories
are defined by three elements (1) the set of fine-grained histories of the
closed system which are its most refined possible description, (2) the allowed
coarse grainings which are partitions of the fine-grained histories into
classes, and (3) a decoherence functional which measures interference between
coarse grained histories. Probabilities are assigned to sets of alternative
coarse-grained histories that decohere as a consequence of the closed system's
dynamics and initial condition. Generalized sum-over histories quantum theories
are constructed for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, abelian gauge theories,
a single relativistic world line, and for general relativity. For relativity
the fine-grained histories are four-metrics and matter fields. Coarse grainings
are four-dimensional diffeomorphism invariant partitions of these. The
decoherence function is expressed in sum-over-histories form. The quantum
mechanics of spacetime is thus expressed in fully spacetime form. The
coarse-grainings are most general notion of alternative for quantum theory
expressible in spacetime terms. Hamiltonian quantum mechanics of matter fields
with its notion of unitarily evolving state on a spacelike surface is recovered
as an approximation to this generalized quantum mechanics appropriate for those
initial conditions and coarse-grainings such that spacetime geometry

annihilation amplitudes which possess poles and thresholds, as they impact on
the calculated neutralino relic density and therefore on the cosmological
viability of supersymmetric models. We focus on two typical resonances, namely
the $Z$ boson and the lightest Higgs boson ($h$). In the context of
supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, an
exploration of the whole parameter space of the model is possible and the
overall relevance of these sophisticated analyses can be ascertained. As an
example we chose the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model since the presence of
such poles is essential to obtain a cosmologically acceptable model. We find
that the proper thermal averaging is important for individual points in
parameter space and that the fraction of cosmologically acceptable points is
increased somewhat by the accurate procedure. However, qualitatively the new
set of points is very similar to that obtained previously using the usual
series approximations to the thermal average. We conclude that all
phenomenological analyses based on the previously determined cosmologically
allowed set remain valid.

controlled by exploring the Lagrangian's parameter space so as to maximize the

$g=2$ is known to yield an additional scattering and zero modes (one for each
flux quantum), an anomaly of the magnetic moment (i.e. $g>2$) leads to bound
states. We considered two methods for treating the case $g>2$. \\ The first is
the method of self adjoint extension of the corresponding Hamilton operator. It
yields one bound state as well as additional scattering. In the second we
consider three exactly solvable models for finite flux tubes and take the limit
of shrinking its radius to zero. For finite radius, there are $N+1$ bound
states ($N$ is the number of flux quanta in the tube).\\ For $R\to 0$ the bound
state energies tend to infinity so that this limit is not physical unless $g\to
2$ along with $R\to 0$. Thereby only for fluxes less than unity the results of
the method of self adjoint extension are reproduced whereas for larger fluxes
$N$ bound states exist and we conclude that this method is not applicable.\\ We
discuss the physically interesting case of small but finite radius whereby the

equation, in comparison with the ordinary imaginary-time formalism. Once we
specify the vertex function, we can write down the SD equation with only
continuous variables without performing the discrete sum over Matsubara
frequencies which cannot be performed in advance without further approximation
in the imaginary-time formalism. By solving the SD equation obtained in this
way, we find the chiral-symmetry restoring transition at finite-temperature and
present the associated phase diagram of strong coupling QED.
  In solving the SD equation, we consider two approximations:
instantaneous-exchange and $p_0$-independent ones. The former has a direct
correspondence in the imaginary time formalism, while the latter is a new
approximation beyond the former, since the latter is able to incorporate new
thermal effects which has been overlooked in the ordinary imaginary-time
solution. However both approximations are shown to give qualitatively the same
results on the finite-temperature phase transition.
