UM AC 93-5","Astrophys.J.426:23-37,1994","10.1086/174036",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop a general method for power spectrum analysis of three dimensional
redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical
uncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting
scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that
the long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the
formalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our
results to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the
Berkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify
the impression from e.g.\ counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on
large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\Omega h\simeq 0.5$.
We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\Omega h$ as a free
parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting
parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally,
we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This
agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian
fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal
no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type electron-phonon model for doped C$_{60}$ is solved
with gaussian bond disorders and also with site disorders. Sample average is
performed over sufficient number of disorder configurations. The distributions
of bond lengths and electron densities are shown as functions of the disorder
strength and the additional electron number. Stability of polaron excitations
as well as dimerization patterns is studied. Polarons and dimerizations in
lightly doped cases (C$_{60}^{-1,-2}$) are relatively stable against disorders,
indicated by peak structures in distribution functions. In more heavily doped
cases, the several peaks merge into a single peak, showing the breakdown of
polaron structures as well as the decrease of the dimerization strength.
Possibility of the observation of polaronic lattice distortions and electron
structures in doped C$_{60}$ is discussed.

  LPQTH-93/06",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.49.12318",,"cond-mat",,"  The formation of bound states of holes in an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2
background is studied using numerical techniques applied to the ${\rm t-J}$
Hamiltonian on clusters with up to 26 sites. An analysis of the binding energy
as a function of cluster size suggests that a two hole bound state is formed
for couplings larger than a ``critical'' value ${\rm J/t]_c}$. The symmetry of
the bound state is $\dx2y2$. We also observed that its ``quasiparticle'' weight
${\rm Z_{2h}}$ (defined in the text), is finite for all values of the coupling
${\rm J/t}$. Thus, in the region ${\rm J/t \geq J/t]_c}$ the bound state of two
holes behaves like a quasiparticle with charge $Q=2e$, spin $S=0$, and $\dx2y2$
internal symmetry. The relation with recent ideas that have suggested the
possibility of d-wave pairing in the high temperature cuprate superconductors
is briefly discussed.

of the results in Kac-Moody algebra can be generalized to the super case. Of
most importance are the generalized Kac-Kazhdan formula and the
Malikov-Feigin-Fuchs construction, which give the weights and the explicit form
of the singular vectors in the Verma module over affine Kac-Moody
superalgebras. We have also considered the decomposition of the admissible
representation of $\hat{OSP(1,2)}$ into that of $\hat{SL(2)}\otimes$Virasoro
algebra, through which we get the modular transformations on the torus and the
fusion rules. Different boundary conditions on the torus correspond to the
different modings of the current superalgebra and characters or
super-characters, which might be relevant to the Hamiltonian reduction
resulting in Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond superconformal algebras. Finally, the
Felder BRST complex, which consists of Wakimoto modules by the free field
realization, is constructed.
