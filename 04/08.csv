of $\Bbb P^r$'s contained in $X$. If $X$ is generic, then $F_X$ will have the
expected dimension (or empty) and its class in the Chow ring of $G(r+1,n+1)$ is
given by the top Chern class of the vector bundle $S^dU^*$, where $U$ is the
universal subbundle on the Grassmannian $G(r+1,n+1)$. When we deform a generic
$X$ into a degenerate $X_0$, the dimension of $F_X$ can jump. In this case,
there is a subscheme $F_{lim}$ of $F_{X_0}$ with the expected dimension which
consists of limiting $\Bbb P^r$'s in $X_0$ with respect to a general
deformation. The simplest example is the well-known case of $27$ lines in a
generic cubic surface. If we degenerate the surface into the union of a plane
and a quadric, then there are infinitely many lines in the union. Which $27$
lines are the limiting ones and how many of them are in the plane and how many
of them are in the quadric? The goal of this paper is to study $F_{lim}$ in
general.

scalar Majorana field violates the lepton number and produces the mass
splitting of the neutrino due to the sea-saw mechanism. In this model a quasar
is an object which appears in the result of the first order cosmological phase

Delta-33-resonances is investigated using the formalism of Thermo Field
Dynamics. After a discussion of the zero Delta-width approximation at finite
temperature, we take into account a constant width of the resonance. Apart from
a full numerical calculation, we give analytical approximations to the pionic
spectral function including such a width. They are found to be different from
previous approximations, and require an increase of the effective Delta-width
in hot compressed nuclear matter. The results are summarized in an effective
dispersion relation for interacting pions.

absence of stable, observable asymptotic states. We show, how the introduction
of {\it statistical} quasi-particles (stable, but not observable) gives rise to
a consistent description. Statistical and spectral information can be cleanly
separated also for interacting systems.
