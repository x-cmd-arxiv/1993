bar-like features based on HI and star count data. In this paper, I show that
such features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR.
The effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of
the pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the
kinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and
therefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to
probe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy.
Kinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with
evolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than
those with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational
constraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating
spheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent
the proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar
kinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\kpc$ will cause a
large increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\sim5\kpc$) with
little change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by
K-giant velocity data. Potential future observations and analyses are
discussed.
