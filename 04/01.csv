(1988), in which a genetic algorithm is used to evolve cellular automata (CA)
to perform a particular computational task. Packard examined the frequency of
evolved CA rules as a function of Langton's lambda parameter (Langton, 1990),
and interpreted the results of his experiment as giving evidence for the
following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules able to perform complex computations are
most likely to be found near ``critical'' lambda values, which have been
claimed to correlate with a phase transition between ordered and chaotic
behavioral regimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complex
computation, evolution will tend to select rules with lambda values close to
the critical values. Our experiment produced very different results, and we
suggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We also
review and discuss issues related to lambda, dynamical-behavior classes, and
computation in CA. The main constructive results of our study are identifying
the emergence and competition of computational strategies and analyzing the
central role of symmetries in an evolutionary system. In particular, we
demonstrate how symmetry breaking can impede the evolution toward higher
computational capability.

coherence effects obey uncertainty principle-type inequalities of the form
$|\Delta E|\,{\Delta \tau} \lprox 1\,$. Here $|\Delta E|$ is the magnitude of
the negative energy which is transmitted on a timescale $\Delta \tau$. Our main
focus in this paper is on negative energy fluxes which are produced by the
motion of observers through static negative energy regions. We find that
although a quantum inequality appears to be satisfied for radially moving
geodesic observers in two and four-dimensional black hole spacetimes, an
observer orbiting close to a black hole will see a constant negative energy
flux. In addition, we show that inertial observers moving slowly through the
Casimir vacuum can achieve arbitrarily large violations of the inequality. It
seems likely that, in general, these types of negative energy fluxes are not
constrained by inequalities on the magnitude and duration of the flux. We
construct a model of a non-gravitational stress-energy detector, which is
rapidly switched on and off, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such a
detector.

string dynamics in the lorentzian and euclidean regimes. In the lorentzian case
all the physics reduces to a massless scalar particle described by a
Klein-Gordon type equation with a singular effective potential. The scattering
matrix is found and it reproduces the results obtained by coset CFT techniques.
It factorizes into two pieces : an elastic coulombian amplitude and an
absorption part. In both parts, an infinite sequence of imaginary poles in the
energy appear. The generic features of string propagation in curved
D-dimensional backgrounds (string stretching, fall into spacetime
singularities) are analyzed in the present case. A new physical phenomenon
specific to the present black-hole is found : the quantum renormalization of
the speed of light. We find $c_{quantum} = \sqrt{{k\o{k-2}}}~c_{classical}$,
where $k$ is the integer in front of the WZW action. This feature is, however,
a pathology. Only for $ k \to \infty$ the pathology disappears (although the
conformal anomaly is present). We analyze all the classical euclidean string
solutions and exactly compute the quantum partition function. No critical
Hagedorn temperature appears here.

(faster than the Fast Fourier Transform, which we briefly explain), but
approximation by piecewise constants is poor. To improve this first wavelet, we
are led to dilation equations and their unusual solutions. Higher-order
wavelets are constructed, and it is surprisingly quick to compute with them ---
always indirectly and recursively. We comment informally on the contest between
these transforms in signal processing, especially for video and image
compression (including high-definition television). So far the Fourier
Transform --- or its 8 by 8 windowed version, the Discrete Cosine Transform ---
is often chosen. But wavelets are already competitive, and they are ahead for
fingerprints. We present a sample of this developing theory.
