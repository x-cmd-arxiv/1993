compact stars with alternate layers of neutrons and quarks. One can determine
on the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is
energetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a
quark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark
parameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past
work in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior
and interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters,
a star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter.
Given the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the
probability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars),
stars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer
models are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a
thorough search of the quark parameter space are presented.

Heisenberg spin-1 chain with the most general single-ion anisotropy. We discuss
the regime in which the magnetic field is below the transition value. The
splitting of the Haldane triplet is obtained as a function of a field applied
in an arbitrary orientation by means of a Lancz\H os exact diagonalization of
chains of up to 16 spins. Our results are nicely summarized in terms of a
first-order perturbation theory. We explain various level crossings that occur
by the existence of discrete symmetries. A discussion is given of the electron
spin resonance and neutron scattering experiments on the compound
Ni(C$_2$H$_8$N$_2$)$_2$NO$_2$ClO$_4$ (NENP).

  Experiments","8 pages, LaTeX, Los Alamos preprint LA-UR-93-1532",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  A purely left-chiral model of the weak interactions is used to show that the
total parity-violating asymmetry in quark-quark scattering must grow with
increasing energy. In the absence of other new physics, non-observation of a
large asymmetry can therefore be used to infer an upper bound on the mass scale
for new right-chiral weak vector bosons. Applying this idea to actual
nucleon-nucleon scattering requires more involved calculations, as the dominant
contribution appears to come from a component of diquark-quark scattering
related to, but not identical to, wavefunction-mixing. Earlier criticism of
this model by Simonius and Unger is refuted and a new calculation is proposed
as an additional check on the result. Finally, we argue that the so-called
`spin crisis' does not affect our conclusions. (Talk given at the BNL workshop
on future directions in particle and nuclear physics at multi-GeV hadron beam
facilities, March 4--6, 1993.)
