all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under
consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use
the available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and
the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate
whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the
angular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the
distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true
variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max}
test to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\chi^2$
test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis),
including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible
observational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two
distributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for
ruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo
simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$
it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.
Currently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large
disagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of
comets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts.

the hierarchy, which are mostly due to the presence of boundary problems in the

scaling is however also found in $n \geq -1$ models. For the first time, due to
our large dynamic range and careful checks of scaling and shot--noise effects,
we are able to detect evolution away from the perturbation theory result.

two-dimensional electron gas systems, where the drag has been studied
experimentally, the effect of disorder on the drag is negligible at attainable

at low temperatures in moderate and low mobility samples.

confinement-deconfinement phase transition occurs (at fixed lattice size) from

simulations with eight heavy flavors and two light flavors show that the eight

algebra') is exhibited. The ${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro `algebra' is shown to be
anomaly free in arbitrary number of target space dimensions. We prove the
existence of a (manifestly unitary) light-cone gauge with anomaly free Lorentz
algebra in any dimensions. The analog of vertex operators are introduced and
the physical spectrum is analysed. There are an infinite number of higher-level
states repeating a certain mass pattern and leading to an infinite degeneracy.
The connection with the continuum string theory (in $D=26$) is investigated.
Independently, following a method recently introduced by 't Hooft based on
Hilbert-space extension of deterministic systems, a particular one-dimensional
cellular automaton submitted to a deterministic evolution is shown to reduce to
a massless scalar field theory at long distance scales. This automaton is
utilized to define a (`cellular') string theory with world-sheet variables
evolving under deterministic rules, which in the framework of
`first-quantization' corresponds to the ${\bf Z}_C$ string theory mentioned
above. We show that in this theory also the target space motion of free strings
is governed by deterministic laws. Finally, we discuss a model for (off-shell)
interacting strings where space-time determinism is fully restored.
