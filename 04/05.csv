variations of M/L) in early-type galaxies, we report deep spectroscopic
observations of the bulge-dominated edge-on S0 galaxy NGC 3115, made at ESO, La
Silla, using EFOSC at the 3.6m telescope and EMMI at NTT. Such observations
allow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii)
from the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \mu_B ~ 24 mag
arcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260
km/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of
our observations. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured;
it decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out
(<\sigma> ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~< 1.3 a_e). Models built
on these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the M/L of NGC 3115 must
thus be increasing from M/L = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e)
to at least M/L >= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e).

gravitational three-body system (three masses on a line with $-1/r$ pairwise
potential). We have concentrated in particular on how the behavior changes when
the relative masses of the three bodies change (with negative total energy).
For two mass choices we have calculated 18000 full orbits (with initial states
on a $100\times 180$ lattice on the Poincar\'e section) and obtained dwell time
distributions. For 105 mass choices we have calculated Poincar\'e maps for
$10\times 18$ starting points. Our results show that the Poincar\'e section
(and hence the phase space) divides into three well defined regions with orbits
of different characteristics: 1) There is a region of fast scattering, with a
minimum of pairwise collisions and smooth dependence on initial values. 2) In
the chaotic scattering region the interaction times are longer, and both the
interaction time and the final state depend sensitively on the starting point
on the Poincar\'e section. For both 1) and 2) the initial and final states
consists of a binary + single particle. 3) The third region consists of
quasiperiodic orbits where the three masses are bound together forever. At the
center of the quasiperiodic region there is the periodic Schubart orbit, whose
stability turns out to correlate strongly with the global behavior.

contrast to the hitherto known bounds on g^2/M^2, and are consequently stronger
at high masses. (ii) The bound from D^0 D^0 bar mixing is the first FCNC bound
in the up sector for chirally-coupled leptoquarks, and is similar in strength
to the K^0 K^0 bar and B^0 B^0 bar bounds. Together, these bounds strongly

stable, such strings would form in the Early Universe in a manner analogous to
the formation of a network of more robust topologically-stable strings. In this
paper we find that except for unnaturally small values of the correlation
length, a network of semilocal strings does not form. Instead, delocalized
skyrmionic string configurations, which expand with the Hubble flow, dominate.

proportional to the derivative of the phase shift. This term is of zero measure
with respect to the integration over momentum variables and can be discarded in
most cases. Yet it carries the full information on phase shifts and can be used
for computation and manipulation of quantities which depend on phase shifts. In
this paper we prove Levinson's theorem in a most general way which assumes only
the completeness of states. In the case of a Dirac particle we obtain a new
result valid for positive and negative energies separately. We also make a
generalization of known results, for the phase shifts in the asymptotic limit
of high energies, to the case of singular potentials. As an application we
consider certain equations, which arise in a generalized interaction picture of
quantum electrodynamics. Using the above mentioned results for the phase shifts
we prove that any solution of these equations, which has a finite number of
bound states, has a total charge zero. Furthermore, we show that in these
equations the coupling constant is not a free parameter, but rather should be
treated as an eigenvalue and hence must have a definite numerical value.
