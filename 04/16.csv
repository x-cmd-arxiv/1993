bimodal in duration. In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the
short ($\le 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that
makes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy
or at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more
sensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long
bursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the
simple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial
distribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles.
The rate of short bursts is $\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the
durations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude
and the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical
long burst by a factor of $\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the
two kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\sim 2$.

strong analogies with the chaotic behaviour: decay of temporal correlations,
positive Shannon entropy, non-constant Renyi entropies of different orders.

characterize the rate of detections as a function of a threshold
signal-to-noise ratio $\rho_0$, the Hubble constant $H_0$, and the binary
``chirp'' mass. For $\rho_0 = 8$, $H_0 = 100$ km/s/Mpc, and $1.4 \msun$ neutron

binaries ($8\times10^{-8}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$) implies LIGO will
observe $\sim 50\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ binary inspiral events. The precision with
which $H_0$ and the deceleration parameter $q_0$ may be determined depends on
the number of observed inspirals. For fixed mass binary systems, $\sim 100$
observations with $\rho_0 = 10$ in the LIGO detector will give $H_0$ to 10\% in
an Einstein-DeSitter cosmology, and 3000 will give $q_0$ to 20\%. For the

A561 (1993) 157-180","10.1016/0375-9474(93)90148-Q",,"nucl-th",,"  The structure of $^6$Li, $^7$Li and $^{11}$Li nuclei is investigated in a
model space which includes all configurations with oscillator energy up to
$3\hbar\omega$ above the ground state configuration. The energy spectra and
electromagnetic properties of the low-lying states are determined with various
two-body interactions, which are derived from the Bonn potential. The results
of these shell-model calculations depend on the strength of the tensor
component contained in the NN interaction and also on the treatment of the
Dirac spinors for the nucleons in the nuclear medium. In addition the
calculation determines the {\it dipole polarizability} of $^7$Li and $^{11}$Li
caused from virtual $E1$ excitations to the positive parity states of these
nuclei. It is demonstrated that the BAGEL scheme provides a very powerful tool
to consider contributions from virtual excitations up to large energies.

Alberg","Semi-Classical Description of Antiproton Capture on Atomic Helium","15 pages, 9 figures may be obtained from authors, Revtex",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.48.2779",,"nucl-th",,"  A semi-classical, many-body atomic model incorporating a momentum-dependent
Heisenberg core to stabilize atomic electrons is used to study antiproton
capture on Helium. Details of the antiproton collisions leading to eventual
capture are presented, including the energy and angular momentum states of
incident antiprotons which result in capture via single or double electron
ionization, i.e. into [He$^{++}\,\bar p$ or He$^{+}\,\bar p$], and the
distribution of energy and angular momentum states following the Auger cascade.
These final states are discussed in light of recently reported, anomalously
long-lived antiproton states observed in liquid He.
