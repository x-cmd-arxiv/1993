free action densities fully covariant. Both the connection and the tetrads are
quadratic forms in these basis vectors. The metric of spacetime, which is
quadratic in the tetrads, is then quartic in the basis vectors.

are now at least nine phenomenological indications that nature is
supersymmetric. All are indirect, so more is better. They are enumerated here.
Some discussion is also given of models, of when and where superpartners might
be directly detected, and of why the scale of supersymmetry cannot be pushed up
if superpartners and SUSY Higgs bosons are not directly detected.

generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be realized as manifolds of dimension
five and seven. Despite their dimension these correspond to superconformal
theories with $c=9$ and so are perfectly good for compactifying the heterotic
string to the four dimensions of space-time. As a check of mirror symmetry we
compute the structure of the space of complex structures of the mirror and
check that this reproduces the known results for the Yukawa couplings and
metric appropriate to the Kahler class parameters on the Z orbifold together
with their instanton corrections.
