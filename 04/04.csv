$q$-state Potts models is nonergodic at zero temperature for $q=3$ on periodic
$3m \times 3n$ lattices where $m,n$ are relatively prime. For $q \ge 4$ and/or
other lattice sizes or boundary conditions, the ergodicity at zero temperature
is an open question.

which is a consequence of its being much heavier than any other scales. One

this article, for processes where there are two external fermions, as well as
any number of bosons. Particularly, we focus on those terms which have power
dependence on the top mass $m_t$.

multiparticle correlations via integrals over correlation functions. A
modification of measures used in the characterization of chaotic dynamical
sytems permits fast and flexible calculation of factorial moments and cumulants
as well as their differential versions. Higher order correlation integral
measurements even of large multiplicity events such as encountered in heavy ion
collisons are now feasible. The change from ``ordinary'' to ``factorial''
powers may have important consequences in other fields such as the study of
galaxy correlations and Bose-Einstein interferometry.

process $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-H\nu$ at TeV $e^-\gamma$ colliders, which are
realized by the laser back-scattering method. We search for the signature of
$W^-H \rightarrow (jj)(b\bar b)$ plus missing transverse momentum, with and
without considering the $b$-tagging. We also analyse all the potential
backgrounds from $e^-\gamma \rightarrow W^-Z\nu,\,W^-W^+e^-,\,ZZe^-,\, \bar t
b\nu$ and $t\bar t e^-$. With our selective acceptance cuts these backgrounds
are reduced to a manageable level. We find that for the entire intermediate
mass range 60 -- 150~GeV the Higgs discovery should be viable. We also present
detail formulas for the helicity amplitudes of these processes.
