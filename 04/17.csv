  Halo ?","15 pages, Latex, Submitted to ApJ.Lett",,,,"astro-ph",,"  If a substantial fraction of the observed gamma-ray bursts originates within
an extended Galactic halo then their spatial distribution should deviate
slightly from spherical symmetry in a very particular way which involves
features both in the bursts' angular and radial distributions.
  This conclusion is based on various reasons which are all related to the
presence and motion of the satellite galaxies around the Galaxy, and is
independent of the nature and origin of the sources.
  We analyze the spatial distribution of the bursts, according to the BATSE
catalog until March 1992, and argue that the expected signature of an extended
Galactic halo model is indicated by the data. The distance to the faintest
bursts in the halo is either $\sim130$ Kpc or $\sim270$ Kpc.
  Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is
very suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary
before regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence. If the increasing data
supports our results then gamma-ray bursts may be the first detected
manifestations of nearby intergalactic objects, either primordial or which have
escaped predominantely from our satellite galaxies.

dominated universe, the typical density contrast changes from $\delta\simeq
10^{-4}$ to $\delta\simeq 10^2$. However, during the same time, the typical
value of the gravitational potential generated by the perturbations changes
only by a factor of order unity. This significant fact can be exploited to
provide a new, powerful, approximation scheme for studying the formation of
nonlinear structures in the universe. This scheme, discussed in this paper,
evolves the initial perturbation using a Newtonian gravitational potential
frozen in time. We carry out this procedure for different intial spectra and
compare the results with the Zeldovich approximation and the frozen flow
approximation (proposed by Mattarrese et al. recently). Our results are in far
better agreement with the N-body simulations than the Zeldovich approximation.
It also provides a dynamical explanation for the fact that pancakes remain thin
during the evolution. While there is some superficial similarity between the
frozen flow results and ours, they differ considerably in the velocity
information. Actual shell crossing does occur in our approximation; also there
is motion of particles along the pancakes leading to further clumping. These
features are quite different from those in frozen flow model. We also discuss
the evolution of the two-point correlation function in various approximations.

non-linear regime is investigated. The underlying equations of motion are cast
in a suggestive form, and motivate a conjecture that the scaled pair velocity,
$h(a,x)\equiv -[v/(\dot{a}x)]$ depends on the expansion factor $a$ and comoving
coordinate $x$ only through the density contrast $\sigma(a,x)$. This leads to
the result that the true, non-linear, density contrast
$<(\delta\rho/\rho)^{2}_{x}>^{1/2}=\sigma(a,x)$ is a universal function of the
density contrast $\sigma_L(a,l)$, computed in the linear theory and evaluated
at a scale $l$ where $l=x(1+\sigma^2)^{1/3}$. This universality is supported by
existing numerical simulations with scale-invariant initial conditions having
different power laws. We discuss a physically motivated ansatz
$h(a,x)=h[\sigma^2(a,x)]$ and use it to compute the non-linear density contrast
at any given scale analytically. This provides a promising method for analysing
the non-linear evolution of density perturbations in the universe and for
interpreting numerical simulations.

For small momenta, the two loop contribution from the pseudoscalar meson octet

low momentum gives the ${\cal O}(q^6)$ counterterm in the chiral Lagrangian) is
calculated within a relativistic constituent quark model incorporating the
momentum dependence of the quark mass. The perturbative gluons of QCD are
included in a standard fashion. The total result is close to an estimate of
$\Pi_{had}(q^2)$ that is obtained directly from $e^+e^-\to hadrons$ data. We
further use our results for $\Pi_{had}(q^2)$ to calculate the ${\cal O}(e^4)$
hadronic contribution to lepton magnetic moments and to calculate
$\alpha_{QED}(M_Z^2)$. A simpler model of constituent quarks with momentum
independent masses gives less favourable results.

energy'' terms added for $B$ and $A$, it generates a mass for $A$ thereby
suggesting an alternative to the Higgs mechanism, and also gives the London
equations. The $BF$ action, being the large length and time scale limit of this
augmented action, is thus of physical interest. In earlier work, it has been
studied on spatial manifold $\Sigma $ with boundaries $\partial \Sigma $, and
the existence of edge states localised at $\partial \Sigma $ has been
established. They are analogous to the conformal family of edge states to be
found in a Chern-Simons theory in a disc. Here we introduce charges and
vortices (thin flux tubes) as sources in the $BF$ system and show that they
acquire an infinite number of spin excitations due to renormalization, just as
a charge coupled to a Chern-Simons potential acquires a conformal family of
spin excitations. For a vortex, these spins are transverse and attached to each
of its points, so that it resembles a ribbon. Vertex operators for the creatin
of these sources are constructed and interpreted in terms of a Wilson integral
involving $A$ and a similar integral involving $B$. The standard
spin-statistics theorem is proved for this sources. A new spin-statistics
theorem, showing the equality of the ``interchange'' of two identical vortex
loops and $2\pi $ rotation of the transverse spins of a constituent vortex, is
established. Aharonov-Bohm interactions of charges and vortices are studied.
