coalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional
constructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we
incorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay
driven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition
between the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and
the rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show
that a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate
the coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close
binary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars.
Calculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and
effective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall
velocity just prior to contact is about 10\% of the tangential orbital
velocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger
binary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also
consider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other.
We show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of
the components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity
is high enough to maintain corotation.

of the KAM theorem by direct bounds of the $k$--th order coefficient of the
perturbation expansion of the parametric equations of the tori in terms of
their average anomalies: this extends Siegel's approach, from the linearization
of analytic maps to the KAM theory; the convergence radius does not depend, in

we look for the cancellations that must be present because the homoclinic
intersections of the whiskers are {\it ""quasi flat""}, if the rotation velocity
of the quasi periodic motion on the tori is large. We rederive in this way the
result that, under suitable conditions, the homoclinic splitting is smaller

as q-deformations of the single soliton solution corresponding to the

eigenfunctions and transmission coefficients for these potentials are obtained.
We show that these potentials can also be obtained numerically. Included as an
intriguing case is a shape invariant double well potential whose supersymmetric
partner potential is only a single well. Our class of exactly solvable
Hamiltonians is further enlarged by examining two new directions: (i) changes
of parameters which are different from the previously studied cases of
translation and scaling; (ii) extending the usual concept of shape invariance
in one step to a multi-step situation. These extensions can be viewed as
q-deformations of the harmonic oscillator or multi-soliton solutions
