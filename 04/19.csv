  29/93",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.48.1305",,"cond-mat",,"  The growth of a diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) cluster with mass $M$ and
radius of gyration $R$ is described by a set of growth probabilities $\{
p_i\}$, where $p_i$ is the probability that the perimeter site $i$ will be the
next to grow. We introduce the joint distribution $N(\alpha, x, M)$, where
$N(\alpha,x,M)d\alpha dx$ is the number of perimeter sites with $\alpha$-values
in the range $\alpha\le \alpha_i \le \alpha+d\alpha$ (``$\alpha$-sites'') and
located in the annulus [x, x+dx] around the cluster seed. Here, $\alpha_i
\equiv -\ln p_i / \ln R$ if $p_i>0$, $x\equiv r_i/R$, and $r_i$ is the distance
of site $i$ from the seed of the DLA cluster. We use $N(\alpha,x,M)$ to relate
multifractal and multiscaling properties of DLA. In particular, we find that
for large $M$ the location of the $\alpha$-sites is peaked around a fixed value
$\bar x(\alpha)$; in contrast, the perimeter sites with $p_i=0$ are uniformly
distributed over the DLA cluster.

  Perez-Mercader, and W. Zurek, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,(1994)",,"UCSBTH01-31","gr-qc hep-th",,"  We investigate the origin of the arrow of time in quantum mechanics in the
context of quantum cosmology. The ``Copenhagen'' quantum mechanics of measured
subsystems incorporates a fundamental arrow of time. Extending discussions of
Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebovitz, Griffiths, and others we investigate a
generalized quantum mechanics for cosmology that utilizes both an initial and a
final density matrix to give a time-neutral formulation without a fundamental
arrow of time. Time asymmetries can arise for particular universes from
differences between their initial and final conditions. Theories for both would
be a goal of quantum cosmology. A special initial condition and a final
condition of indifference would be sufficient to explain the observed time
asymmetries of the universe. In this essay we ask under what circumstances a
completely time symmetric universe, with T-symmetric initial and final
condition, could be consistent with the time asymmetries of the limited domain
of our experience. We discuss the approach to equilibrium, the electromagnetic
system, and T-violation in the weak interactions in such universes.
  The decoherence of alternatives that is necessary for the prediction of
probabilities in the quantum mechanics of closed systems is the origin of a
fundamental limitation on quantum cosmologies with initial and final
conditions. The initial and final density matrices cannot both be pure; if they
are there is no decoherence and no prediction.

masses if a discrete symmetry is imposed which forbids tree level Dirac
neutrino masses but allows for radiative mass generation. Since the only
possible symmetries of this kind are known to be generation dependent, we
explore the possibility that the three sets of light states in each generation
do not have the same assignments with respect to the 27 of $E_6$, leading to
non universal gauge interactions under the additional $U(1)'$ factors for the
known fermions. We argue that models realising such a scenario are viable, with
their structure being constrained mainly by the requirement of the absence of
flavor changing neutral currents in the Higgs sector. Moreover, in contrast to
the standard case, rank 6 models are not disfavoured with respect to rank 5. By
requiring the number of light neutral states to be minimal, these models have
an almost unique pattern of neutrino masses and mixings. We construct a model
based on the unconventional assignment scenario in which (with a natural choice
of the parameters) $m_{\nut}\sim O(10)$eV is generated at one loop, $m_{\num}$
is generated at two loops and lies in a range interesting for the solar
neutrino problem, and $\nue$ remains massless. In addition, since baryon and
lepton number are conserved, there is no proton decay in the model. To
illustrate the non-standard phenomenology implied by our scheme we also discuss
a second scenario in which an attempt for solving the solar neutrino puzzle
with matter enhanced oscillations and practically massless neutrinos can be
formulated, and in which peculiar effects for the $\num$ --> $\nut$ conversion
of the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos could arise as well.

scenario when the transition proceeds via bubble nucleation. We show that the
space-time dependent phase for the Higgs vacuum expectation values coming from
the spontaneous CP violation can give rise to a efficient generation of baryon
number inside the bubble walls if the superpotential parameters and the soft
supersymmetry breaking ones are complex. However we find that in order to get
the observed value for the baryon asymmetry of the universe the phases of such
parameters can be as small as $10^{-5}$, giving rise to an electron dipole
moment of the neutron well below the current experimental limit. Moreover a
light Higgs pseudoscalar is needed, and an upper bound on its mass is obtained.

This allows to obtain systematic corrections to the results of Polchinski et

the rigid string, and to analyze the intermediate range of temperatures. In
particular, a way to obtain the Hagedorn temperature for the rigid membrane is
