softer for higher quark masses and interaction strength. The quark stars
properties are found to be dependent on EOS. The mass, radius, moment of

approximation, and it turns out that the $s$-wave amplitudes are dominated by
the low-lying $\halfm$ resonances, while $p$-wave ones governed by the
ground-state $\halfp$ poles. The MIT bag model is employed to calculate the
coupling constants, form factors and baryon matrix elements. Our conclusions
are: (i) $s$ waves are no longer dominated by commutator terms; the
current-algebra method is certainly not applicable to parity-violating
amplitudes, (ii) nonfactorizable $W$ exchange effects are generally important;
they can be comparable to and somtimes even dominate over factorizable
contributions, depending on the decay modes under consideration, (iii)
large-$N_c$ approximation for factorizable amplitudes also works in the heavy
baryon sector and it accounts for the color nonsuppression of $\lamc\ri
p\bar{K}^0$ relative to $\lamc\ri\Lambda\pi^+$, (iv) a measurement of the decay
rate and the sign of the $\alpha$ asymmetry parameter of certain proposed decay
modes will help discern various models; especially the sign of $\alpha$ in
$\lamc\ri\Sigma\pi$ decays can be used to unambiguously differentiate recent
theoretical schemes from current algebra, and (v) $p$ waves are the dominant
contributions to the decays $\lamc\ri\Xi^0 K^+$ and $\xin\ri\Sigma^+ K^-$, but
they are subject to a large cancellation; this renders present theoretical

field theory. By crossover we mean the interpolation between different
representations of the conformal group by the action of relevant operators. At
the level of the RG this crossover is manifest in the flow between different
fixed points induced by these operators. The description of such flows requires
a RG which is capable of interpolating between qualitatively different degrees
of freedom. Using the conceptual notion of course graining we construct some
simple examples of such a group introducing the concept of a ``floating'' fixed
point around which one constructs a perturbation theory. Our consideration of
crossovers indicates that one should consider classes of field theories,
described by a set of parameters, rather than focus on a particular one. The
space of parameters has a natural metric structure. We examine the geometry of
this space in some simple models and draw some analogies between this space,
superspace and minisuperspace.
