using the one-loop semiclassical approximation. The data being parameterized
includes a choice of complex structure on the manifold, as well as some ``extra
structure'' described by means of classes in H^2. The expectation that this
moduli space is well-behaved in these ``extra structure'' directions leads us
to formulate a simple and compelling conjecture about the action of the
automorphism group on the K\""ahler cone. If true, it allows one to apply
Looijenga's ``semi-toric'' technique to construct a partial compactification of
the moduli space. We explore the implications which this construction has
concerning the properties of the moduli space of complex structures on a
``mirror partner'' of the original Calabi-Yau manifold. We also discuss how a
similarity which might have been noticed between certain work of Mumford and of
Mori from the 1970's produces (with hindsight) evidence for mirror symmetry
which was available in 1979. [The author is willing to mail hardcopy preprints

  `macros')",,,,"comp-gas nlin.CG",,"  Wavelet based algorithms in numerical analysis are similar to other transform
methods in that vectors and operators are expanded into a basis and the
computations take place in this new system of coordinates. However, due to the
recursive definition of wavelets, their controllable localization in both space
and wave number (time and frequency) domains, and the vanishing moments
property, wavelet based algorithms exhibit new and important properties.
  For example, the multiresolution structure of the wavelet expansions brings
about an efficient organization of transformations on a given scale and of
interactions between different neighbouring scales. Moreover, wide classes of
operators which naively would require a full (dense) matrix for their numerical
description, have sparse representations in wavelet bases. For these operators
sparse representations lead to fast numerical algorithms, and thus address a
critical numerical issue.
  We note that wavelet based algorithms provide a systematic generalization of
the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its descendents.
  These topics will be the subject of the lecture. Starting from the notion of
multiresolution analysis, we will consider the so-called non-standard form
(which achieves decoupling among the scales) and the associated fast numerical
algorithms. Examples of non-standard forms of several basic operators (e.g.
derivatives) will be computed explicitly.
