  93/1",,"10.1093/mnras/265.2.379",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  Recent large scale structure observations, including COBE, have prompted many
authors to discuss modifications of the standard Cold Dark Matter model. Two of
these, a tilted spectrum and a gravitational wave contribution to COBE, are at
some level demanded by theory under the usual assumption that inflation
generates the primeval perturbations. The third, whose motivation comes by
contrast from observation, is the introduction of a component of hot dark
matter to give the Mixed Dark Matter model. We discuss the implication of
taking these modifications together. Should Mixed Dark Matter prove necessary,
very strong constraints on inflationary models will ensue.

  Thermal Fluctuations","36 pages (revised uncorrupted version), Report IC 92-93/25","Phys.Rev. D48 (1993) 2753-2765","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.2753",,"gr-qc cond-mat hep-th",,"  We study an information-theoretic measure of uncertainty for quantum systems.
It is the Shannon information $I$ of the phase space probability distribution
$\la z | \rho | z \ra $, where $|z \ra $ are coherent states, and $\rho$ is the
density matrix. The uncertainty principle is expressed in this measure as $I
\ge 1$. For a harmonic oscillator in a thermal state, $I$ coincides with von
Neumann entropy, $- \Tr(\rho \ln \rho)$, in the high-temperature regime, but
unlike entropy, it is non-zero at zero temperature. It therefore supplies a
non-trivial measure of uncertainty due to both quantum and thermal
fluctuations. We study $I$ as a function of time for a class of non-equilibrium
quantum systems consisting of a distinguished system coupled to a heat bath. We
derive an evolution equation for $I$. For the harmonic oscillator, in the
Fokker-Planck regime, we show that $I$ increases monotonically. For more
general Hamiltonians, $I$ settles down to monotonic increase in the long run,
but may suffer an initial decrease for certain initial states that undergo
``reassembly'' (the opposite of quantum spreading). Our main result is to
prove, for linear systems, that $I$ at each moment of time has a lower bound
$I_t^{min}$, over all possible initial states. This bound is a generalization
of the uncertainty principle to include thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium
systems, and represents the least amount of uncertainty the system must suffer
after evolution in the presence of an environment for time $t$.

the right side up harmonic oscillator potential.

states is formulated based on the instant constraint in the Breit frame. The
quasipotential electromagnetic current is derived from Mandelstam's five-point
kernel and obeys a two-body Ward identity. Breit-frame wave functions are
obtained directly by solving integral equations with nonzero total
three-momentum, thus accomplishing a dynamical boost. Calculations of
electron-deuteron elastic form factors illustrate the importance of the
dynamical boost versus kinematic boosts of the rest frame wave functions.
