Albano, is modified to have an unbounded dissociation range. The resulting
dynamical equations are solved exactly. A related k-mer dissociation model is
also introduced and its solution obtained as a quadrature.

  Quantum Wires due to Spin-Splitting","9 pages, LaTeX and APS-RevteX, Rep.No. GF65,Figures from author",,"10.1063/1.109425",,"cond-mat",,"  We show that a quantum wire device with spin splitting can work as an active
spin polarizer. Hot electrons in one `spin' subband (e.g. `spin-up') may pass
such a device with weak electron pair scattering, while electrons in the
opposite subband (`spin-down') may have high conversion probability into the
`spin-up' subband, resulting in spin polarization of a hot electron beam. Under
different circumstances a hot electron beam passing through a single mode
quantum wire may induce a steady state magnetization of the background electron
gas in a section of the wire weakly coupled to the environment.

direction so as to minimize the free energy of the system. As a result, initial
spatio-temporal patterns ultimately decay toward uniform states. The absence of
a variational principle far from equilibrium allows the coexistence of domain
walls propagating in any direction. As a consequence, *persistent* patterns may
emerge. We study this mechanism of pattern formation using a non-variational
extension of Landau's model for second order phase transitions. PACS numbers:
