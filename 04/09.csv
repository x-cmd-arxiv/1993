Collective charge transport is studied in one- and two-dimensional arrays of
small normal-metal dots separated by tunnel barriers. At temperatures well
below the charging energy of a dot, disorder leads to a threshold for
conduction which grows linearly with the size of the array. For short-ranged
interactions, one of the correlation length exponents near threshold is found
from a novel argument based on interface growth. The dynamical exponent for the
current above threshold is also predicted analytically, and the requirements

metric with a linear (affine) connection. The Lagrangian of this interaction is
an arbitrary analytic function $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature. This is a
classically integrable model. The space of classical solutions of the theory
consists from sectors with constant curvature. In each sector the equations of
motion reduce to the standard string equations and to an additional constant
curvature equation for the linear connection. A bifurcation in the space of all
Lagrangians takes place. Quantization of the model is briefly discussed. In a
quasiclassical approximation one gets the standard string model with a
fluctuating cosmological constant. The Lagrangian $f(R)$, like Morse function,
governs transitions between manifolds with different topologies.

model with explicit quarks. We solve the model using a Fock-space configuration
consisting of three quarks plus three quarks and a pion as the ground state
ansatz in place of the ``hedgehog'' ansatz. We minimize the expectation value
of the chiral hamiltonian in this ground state configuration and solve the
resulting equations for nucleon quantum numbers. We calculate the canonical set
of nucleon observables and compare with previous work.

thickness in a Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck transport model of heavy ion
collisions. Well defined surfaces are introduced by giving test particles a
Gaussian density profile of constant width. Zeros of the flow excitation
function are as much influenced by the surface thickness as the nuclear
equation of state, and the dependence of this effect is understood in terms of
a simple potential scattering model. Realistic calculations must also take into
account medium effects for the nucleon--nucleon cross section, and impact
parameter averaging. We find that balance energy scales with the mass number as
$A^{-y}$, where $y$ has a numerical value between 0.35 and 0.5, depending on
the assumptions about the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section.
