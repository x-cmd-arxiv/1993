indicates that the clump giants have M $\lta 0.70\msun\ $, implying an amount
of mass loss ($\approx 0.6$ \msun) well in excess of that found in globular
cluster stars. Observational constraints on mass loss processes favor the
interpretation that mass loss in cool low-mass giant stars increases with

a multimagnetical demon algorithm. The results for the tunnelling correlation

Within the range of parameters probed, we found that using the bounce derived
from the one-loop effective action requires an unnaturally large prefactor to
match the lattice results. Deviations from the tree-level prediction are seen
in the regime where loop corrections would be expected to become important.
