$\sigma :\tilde{C}\longrightarrow \tilde{C}$ without fixed points is associated
the Prym data which consists of the Prym variety $P:=(1-\sigma )J(\tilde{C})$
with principal polarization $\Xi$ such that $2\Xi$ is algebraically equivalent
to the restriction on $P$ of the canonical polarization $\Theta $ of the
Jacobian $J(\tilde{C})$. In contrast to the classical Torelli theorem the Prym
data does not always determine uniquely the pair $(\tilde{C},\sigma )$ up to
isomorphism. In this paper we introduce an extension of the Prym data as
follows. We consider all symmetric theta divisors $\Theta $ of $J(\tilde{C})$
which have even multiplicity at every point of order 2 of $P$. It turns out
that they form three $P_2$ orbits. The restrictions on $P$ of the divisors of
one of the orbits form the orbit $\{ 2\Xi \} $, where $\Xi $ are the symmetric
theta divisors of $P$. The other restrictions form two $P_2$-orbits
$O_1,O_2\subset \mid 2\Xi \mid $. The extended Prym data consists of $(P,\Xi )$
together with $O_1,O_2$. We prove that it determines uniquely the pair
$(\tilde{C} ,\sigma )$ up to isomorphism provided $g(\tilde{C})\geq 3$. The
proof is analogous to Andreotti's proof of Torelli's theorem and uses the Gauss
map for the divisors of $O_1,O_2$. The result is an analog in genus $>1$ of a
classical theorem for elliptic curves.

that objects (dubbed MACHOs) with masses in the range $10^{-6}M_\odot < M

the Magellanic Clouds with the caveat that only about one in $10^6$ stars will
be lensed at any given time. Our group has recently begun a search for
microlensing using a refurbished 1.27 meter telescope at the Mount Stromlo
Observatory in Australia. Since the summer of 1992, we have been imaging up to
$10^7$ stars a night in the Large Magellanic Cloud using our large format
two-color $3.4\times 10^7$ pixel CCD camera. Here I report on our first results
based on an analysis of $\sim 10^6$ of these stars. Although this is not enough
data to make definitive statements about the nature of the dark matter, we are
able to conclude that the rate of variable star background events is not larger
than the expected MACHO signal.

energy-Casimir) method predicts formal instability of a relative equilibrium in
a Hamiltonian system with symmetry, then with the addition of dissipation, the
relative equilibrium becomes spectrally and hence linearly and nonlinearly
unstable. The energy-momentum method assumes that one is in the context of a
mechanical system with a given symmetry group. Our result assumes that the
dissipation chosen does not destroy the conservation law associated with the
given symmetry group---thus, we consider internal dissipation. This also
includes the special case of systems with no symmetry and ordinary equilibria.
The theorem is proved by combining the techniques of Chetaev, who proved
instability theorems using a special Chetaev-Lyapunov function, with those of
Hahn, which enable one to strengthen the Chetaev results from Lyapunov
instability to spectral instability. The main achievement is to strengthen
Chetaev's methods to the context of the block diagonalization version of the
energy momentum method given by Lewis, Marsden, Posbergh, and Simo. However, we
also give the eigenvalue movement formulae of Krein, MacKay and others both in
general and adapted to the context of the normal form of the linearized
equations given by the block diagonal form, as provided by the energy-momentum
method. A number of specific examples, such as the rigid body with internal
rotors, are provided to illustrate the results.

extensions of the standard model, especially if the possibility for eventual
direct evidence becomes unlikely. In this review, we discuss processes that are
important as a test of either the standard model or supergravity. Moreover,
some of these are important even for both the standard model and for
supergravity. Particular attention is paid to the reduction of uncertainties in
the calculation, especially the ones coming from the confinement effects.
Recent approaches, such as chiral perturbation theory, the large
$N_c$-expansion, QCD sum rules and lattice QCD, are discussed. This is found to
be the best strategy in view of the fact that supersymmetric effects are rather
tiny.

of matrix eigenvalues (i.e. gas particles) is varied while keeping the
effective potential fixed. This model exhibits a transition from a phase whose
continuum behaviour is that of $c=1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity to the
well known pure gravity phase of the original model.The former phase is
character- ised by an extremely large Regge slope $\alpha^\prime$ which scales
as $\beta^{2/5}$ causing the scaling regions of the two phases to overlap. In
this way a continuous flow from one phase to the other is made poss- ible. This
phase transition occurs in the singlet sector of the matrix model. The density
of states and the two puncture correlator at non zero momenta are calculated on
the sphere and are found to behave very differ- ently in the two phases,a fact
which demonstrates the phase transition. We comment on a possible relation
between this transition and large \alpha^\prime$ semiclassical expansions in
the continuum.
