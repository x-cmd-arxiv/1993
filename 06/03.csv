at the cellular level. The only experimentally verified learning rule, Hebb's
rule, is extremely limited in its ability to train networks to perform complex
tasks. An identified cellular mechanism responsible for Hebbian-type long-term
potentiation, the NMDA receptor, is highly versatile. Its function and efficacy
are modulated by a wide variety of compounds and conditions and are likely to
be directed by non-local phenomena. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
NMDA receptors are not essential for some types of learning. We have shown that
another neural network learning rule, the chemotaxis algorithm, is
theoretically much more powerful than Hebb's rule and is consistent with
experimental data. A biased random-walk in synaptic weight space is a learning
rule immanent in nervous activity and may account for some types of learning --
notably the acquisition of skilled movement.

for two-sided (bilateral) operators, which can accomodate in excess of 10 times
