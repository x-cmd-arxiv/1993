scheme. The latter may be embedded into the moduli space of solutions to a

effective way of computing certain intersection numbers (known as Gromov

these computations in the case where the Riemann surface has genus one.

mixing of the known fermions with new states with {\it exotic} weak-isospin

level flavour changing neutral interactions mediated by $Z$ exchange, while if
the mixing is only with new states with {\it ordinary} weak-isospin

isomorphic and non-isomorphic GL(N) invariant vertex operators. We construct a
conformally invariant magnet co nstituted of an alternating mixture of GL(N)
``spins'' operators at different order of represent ation. The corresponding
central charge is calculated by analysing the low temperature beha viour of the
associated free energy. We also comment on possible extensions of our results
for more general classes of mixed systems.

space, $p>1,$ and $(X,\sigma)$ be a space with a finite measure. We prove that
$E$ is isometric to a subspace of the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L_p(X;F)$ only if
$E$ is isometric to a subspace of $F.$ Moreover, every isometry $T$ from $E$
into $L_p(X;F)$ has the form $Te(x)=h(x)U(x)e, e\in E,$ where $h:X\rightarrow
R$ is a measurable function and, for every $x\in X,$ $U(x)$ is an isometry from
$E$ to $F.$

  Here, and in what follows the vector valued $L^p$--\,spaces $L^p(d\mu\,;
L^q(d\nu))$ are meant in Bochner's sense.
  One of our main results is the following, which can be viewed as a refinement
of a lemma due to Varopoulos [V].
  \proclaim Theorem 0.1. Let $(A_0,A_1)$ be as above. Then for all $f$ in
$A_0+A_1$ we have $${1\over 2}\,K_t(f;\,A_0\,,A_1)\leq \sup\,\bigg\{
\Big(\mu(E)\vee t^{-1}\nu(F)\Big)^{-1} \int_{E\times F} \vert
f\vert\,d\mu\,d\nu\,\bigg\} \leq K_t(f;\,A_0\,,A_1)\,,$$ where the supremum
runs over all measurable subsets $E\subset M\,,~ F\subset N$ with positive and
finite measure and $u\!\vee\!v$ denotes the maximum of the reals $u$ and $v$.
