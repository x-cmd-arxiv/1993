under the perturbation of high wave-number noise in the initial conditions.
Analytical estimates are obtained for random initial data with spatial spectral
density k^n, n < 1. Numerical investigations are performed for the case n=0,
using a parallel implementation of the Fast Legendre Transform.

potentials from large amounts of data produced by first-principles
calculations. The method is based on fitting the potential to ab initio atomic
forces of many atomic configurations, including surfaces, clusters, liquids and
crystals at finite temperature. The extensive data set overcomes the
difficulties encountered by traditional fitting approaches when using rich and
complex analytic forms, allowing to construct potentials with a degree of
accuracy comparable to that obtained by ab initio methods. A glue potential for
aluminum obtained with this method is presented and discussed.

weak decays of hadrons containing a single heavy quark. After an introduction
to the underlying physical ideas, we discuss in detail the formalism of the
heavy quark effective theory, including a comprehensive treatment of symmetry
breaking corrections. We then illustrate some nonperturbative approaches, which
aim at a dynamical, QCD-based calculation of the universal form factors of the
effective theory. The main focus is on results obtained using QCD sum rules.
Finally, we perform an essentially model-independent analysis of semileptonic
$B$ meson decays in the context of the heavy quark effective theory.

Jevicki and Yoneya. Using directly the symmetry algebra we obtain explicit
expression for a class of amplitudes in the tree approximation. We also study
the quantum effects in the corresponding collective field theory. In
particular, we compute the ground state energy and the free energy at finite
temperature up to two loops, and the first quantum correction to the two-point
function.
