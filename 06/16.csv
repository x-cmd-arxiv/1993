Introducing peak counts in 1024 ms as a measure of burst brightness $\B$ and
the ratio of peak counts in 64 and 1024 ms as a measure of short timescale
variability $\V$, we find a statistically significant correlation between the
brightness and the short timescale variability of \g-ray bursts. The bursts
which are smoother on short timescales are both faint and bright, while the
bursts which are variable on short timescales are faint only, suggesting the
existence of two distinct morphological classes of bursts.

deviations from gaussian statistics which would be reflected in a nonzero value

observation of the three-point function is limited by cosmic variance, even if
a whole-sky map of $\Delta T$ is available. Here I derive a general formula for
the cosmic variance of the three-point function in terms of integrals over the
two-point function. This formula can be applied to any cosmological model and
to any experimental measurement strategy. It gives a fundamental lower limit on
the magnitude of a measurable three-point correlation function, and hence on
the measurable amount of skewness in the distribution of $\Delta T$.

the first singularity has to appear at the center of symmetry. The result adds
weight to the conjecture that cosmic censorship holds if one replaces dust as
matter model for which naked singularities do form by a collisionless gas
described by the Vlasov equation. The main tool is an estimate which shows that
a solution is global if all the matter remains away from the center of

antisymmetric tensor gauge field. In this formulation the topological current
of this field appears as a source for the electromagnetic field and the
topological charge therefore acts physically as an electric charge. The charged
states of QED lie in the sector where the topological charge is identical to
the matter charge. The antisymmetric field theory, however, admits new sectors
where the topological charge is more general. These nontrivial, electrically
charged, sectors contain massless states orthogonal to the vacuum which are
created by a gauge invariant operator and can be interpreted as coherent states
of photons. We evaluate the correlation functions of these states in the
absence of matter. The new states have a positive definite norm and do interact
with the charged states of QED in the usual way. It is argued that if these new
sectors are in fact realized in nature then a very intense background
electromagnetic field is necessary for the experimental observation of them.
The order of magnitude of the intensity threshold is estimated.
