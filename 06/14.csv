site connected to every other site. It is thus a mean-field model in the
spin-glass sense. We find an exact solution for the steady state probability
distribution of avalanche sizes, and discuss its asymptotics for large N.

cosmologies with explicitely solvable momentum constraints, i.e. Bianchi types
I, II, VII, VIII besides the Bianchi type IX, and special cases, namely the
Friedmann universes, the Kantowski-Sachs space, and Taub-NUT space. Besides the
earlier explicit solution of the Wheeler DeWitt equation for Bianchi type IX,
describing a virtual wormhole fluctuation, an additional explicit solution is
given and identified with the `no-boundary state'.

general possible time-dependent re-definition of the spatial coordinate, as
well as general transformations on the wavefunctions, we show that separation
of variables applies and exact solubility occurs only in a very restricted
class of time-dependent models. We consider the formal structure underlying our
findings, and the relationship between our results and other work on
time-dependent potentials. As an application of our methods, we apply our
results to the calculations of propagators.

729 equations for 45 variables. Fortunately many of the equations turned out to
be simple allowing us to start breaking the problem into smaller ones. In the
end we had a total of 552 solutions, but many of them were either inherited
from two-state solutions or subcases of others. The final list contains 35
nontrivial solutions, most of them new.
