of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks.
Previous numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is
large the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending
and breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will
tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab
displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear
instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for
small bending angles, is $\sim c_sk (k\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\eta$ is the slab
displacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local
vorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss
the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs.
Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock
and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case
is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a
nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock
bounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce
substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the
sound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab
thickness.

  Version 3.141",,"10.1093/mnras/265.1.169",,"astro-ph",,"  The presence of protostellar disks can greatly increase the dissipation
during close stellar encounters, leading to the formation of a significant
population of binaries during the initial collapse and virialization of a
cluster. We have used N-body simulations of collapsing globular clusters to
find the major factors that determine the efficiency of binary formation
through star-disk captures. This work serves the dual purpose of verifying the
results of earlier analytic work as well as examining parameters not testable
by that work. As in the earlier work, typical binary fractions of a few percent
are found. For the parameters studied, the results are found to depend
remarkably little upon disk evolution, the mass distribution of the stars, or
their spatial distribution, though distributions in which the stars are highly
clumped yield binary fractions larger by a factor of a few. The direct N-body
integrations limit the models to relatively small values of N. Semiempirical
relations are derived, however, which allow the results to be extrapolated to
values of N appropriate to globular clusters.

These include: the Neumann oscillator, the cubically nonlinear Schr\""odinger
systems and the sine-Gordon equation. Each system has an associated invariant
spectral curve and may be integrated via the Liouville-Arnold technique. The
linearizing map is the Abel map to the associated Jacobi variety, which is
deduced through separation of variables in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. More
generally, a family of moment maps is derived, identifying certain finite
dimensional symplectic manifolds with rational coadjoint orbits of loop
algebras. Integrable Hamiltonians are obtained by restriction of elements of
the ring of spectral invariants to the image of these moment maps. The
isospectral property follows from the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem, and gives
rise to invariant spectral curves. {\it Spectral Darboux coordinates} are
introduced on rational coadjoint orbits, generalizing the hyperellipsoidal
coordinates to higher rank cases. Applying the Liouville-Arnold integration
technique, the Liouville generating function is expressed in completely
separated form as an abelian integral, implying the Abel map linearization in
the general case.

different widths, projected to angular momenta $l=0$ or 1. To avoid excessively
large dimensions and ``overcompleteness"", stochastic methods were tested for
selecting the gaussians spanning the basis. For $^6$He, we were able to
