framework of the QCD sum rule. The condensates appearing in the OPE side of the
correlators become T-dependent through the interaction with thermal pions. We
present an explicit demonstration that the $O(T^2)$-dependence of the
condensates is completely compensated by the change of the pole residue and the
$\pi + B \rightarrow B'$ scattering effect in the spectral functions. Therefore
the baryon masses are constant to this order, although
$\langle\bar{u}u\rangle_T\simeq\langle\bar{u}u\rangle_0(1-T^2/8f_\pi^2)$, which
is consistent with the chiral symmetry constraint by Leutwyler and Smilga.

with quark antiquark condensates. We then relate the condensate function to the
wave function of pion as a Goldstone mode. This simultaneously yields the pion
also as a quark antiquark bound state as a localised zero mode in vacuum. We
illustrate the above with Nambu Jona-Lasinio model to calculate different
pionic properties in terms of the vacuum structure for breaking of exact or
approximate chiral symmetry, as well as the condensate fluctuations giving rise
to $\sigma$ mesons.

nonperturbative manner using equal time algebra for the interacting field
operators. Potential is replaced by offshell bosonic quanta inside the bound
state of nonrelativistic particles. The bosonic dressing is determined through
energy minimisation, and mass renormalisation is carried out in a
nonperturbative manner. Since the interaction is through a scalar field, it
does not include spin effects. The model however nicely incorporates an
intuitive picture of hadronic bound states in which the gluon fields dress the
quarks providing the binding between them and also simulate the gluonic content
of hadrons in deep inelastic collisions.

Our construction establishes the multi-boson representations of KP hierarchy as
consistent Poisson reductions of standard KP hierarchy within the $R$-matrix
scheme. As a byproduct we obtain a complete description of any
finitely-many-field formulation of KP hierarchy in terms of Darboux coordinates
with respect to the first Hamiltonian structure. This results in a series of
representations of $\Win1\,$ algebra made out of arbitrary even number of boson
