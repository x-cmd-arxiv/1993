inflationary models can, beyond probing the underlying inflationary model,
provide information about the Universe: ionization history, presence of a
cosmological constant, and epoch of matter-radiation equality. Because tensor
perturbations give rise to anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation (CBR)
solely through the Sachs-Wolfe effect we are able to calculate analytically the
variance of the multipole moments of this part of the CBR temperature
anisotropy. In so doing, we carefully take account of the contribution of
tensor perturbations that entered the Hubble radius during both the
matter-dominated and radiation-dominated epoch by means of a transfer function.
The striking feature in the spectrum of multipole amplitudes is a dramatic fall
off for $l\ga \sqrt{1+\zl}$, where $\zl$ is the red shift of the
last-scattering surface. ...

the calculated phase diagram is periodic in offset voltage, in agreement with
previous results. At a special value of this voltage such that states with n

coupling is needed to establish long-range phase coherence in this
approximation. With both diagonal and nearest-neighbor charging energies, the T
= 0 phase diagram has two types of insulating lobes with different kinds of
charge order, and two types of superconducting regions. One of these is a
``supersolid'' in which long-range phase coherence coexists with a frozen

representations such that unification occurs at the string scale
($\sim10^{18}\GeV$). This model is complemented by two string supersymmetry
breaking scenaria: the $SU(N,1)$ no-scale supergravity model and a
dilaton-induced supersymmetry breaking scenario. Both imply universal soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters: $m_0=0, A=0$ and
$m_0=\coeff{1}{\sqrt{3}}m_{1/2}, A=-m_{1/2}$ respectively. In either case the
models depend on only three parameters: $m_t$, $\tan\beta$, and $m_{\tilde g}$.
We present a comparative study of the sparticle and Higgs spectra of both
models and conclude that even though both can be partially probed at the
Tevatron, LEPII, and HERA, a larger fraction of the parameter space of the
no-scale model is actually accessible. In both cases there is a more
constrained version which allows to determine $\tan\beta$ in terms of
$m_t,m_{\tilde g}$. In the strict no-scale case we find that the value of $m_t$
determines the sign of $\mu$ ($\mu>0:\,m_t\lsim135\GeV$,
$\mu<0:\,m_t\gsim140\GeV$) and whether the lightest Higgs boson mass is above

$\tan\beta\approx1.4-1.6$ and $m_t\lsim155\GeV$, $61\GeV\lsim m_h\lsim91\GeV$
follow. Thus, continuing Tevatron top-quark searches and LEPI,II Higgs searches
