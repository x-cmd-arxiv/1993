extreme walls with $\sigma = \sigma_{{\text{ext}}}$ are planar, static walls

$\sigma = \sigma_{{\text{non}}} > \sigma_{{\text{ext}}}$ correspond to
expanding bubbles with observers on either side of the wall being {\em

extreme, non-extreme, and ultra-extreme walls exhibit no, repulsive, and
attractive effective ``gravitational forces,'' respectively. These
``gravitational forces'' are global effects not caused by local curvature.

conjectured that similar positive mass protection occurs in all physical

derivative with respect to a general operator--valued coordinate. The
Hamiltonian form of the equations is expressed in terms of a generalized
bracket operation, which is conjectured to obey a Jacobi identity. The
formalism permits the natural implementation of gauge invariance under
operator--valued gauge transformations. When an operator Hamiltonian exists as
well as a total trace Hamiltonian, as is generally the case in complex quantum
mechanics, one can make an operator gauge transformation from the Heisenberg to
the Schr\""odinger picture. When applied to complex quantum mechanical systems
with one bosonic or fermionic degree of freedom, the formalism gives the usual
operator equations of motion, with the canonical commutation relations emerging
as constraints associated with the operator gauge invariance. More generally,
our methods permit the formulation of quaternionic quantum field theories with
operator--valued gauge invariance, in which we conjecture that the operator
constraints act as a generalization of the usual canonical commutators.

from the action of $U_q(sl_n)$ on the $q$-symmetric algebra $A_q(Mat_n)$ by the
Borel-Weil like approach. Our realization is applicable to the construction of
the free field realization for the $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$ [AOS].

discussed by Munster in hep-th/9305104. The plan of this paper is to begin with
the empty set; use it to form sets and quivers (sets of points plus sets of
arrows between pairs of points); and then use them to make complex vector
spaces and to get the A-D-E Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The Dn Spin(2n) Lie
algebras have spinor representations to describe fermions. D4 Spin(8) triality
gives automorphisms among its vector and two half-spinor representations. D5
Spin(10) contains both Spin(8) and the complexification of the vector
representation of Spin(8). E6 contains both Spin(10) and the two half-spinor
representations of Spin(10), and therefore contains the adjoint representation
of Spin(8) and the complexifications of the vector and the two half-spinor
representations of Spin(8). E6 is the basis for construction of a fundamental
model of physics that is consistent with experiment (see hep-th/9302030,
