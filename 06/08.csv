The case for non-zero cosmological constant is most easily solved via numerical
integration. The most distant objects presently known (approaching redshift z =
5) have implied ages of $\approx$ 1-2 Gyr after the the Big Bang. The range of
such age is narrow, in spite of a variety of cosmological models one might
choose. We give a graphical representation of a variety of cosmological models
and show that a wide range of Hubble constants and values of the age and
density of the universe compatible with modern studies are consistent with
