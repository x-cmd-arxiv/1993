A good example is when the light source and the gravity-wave source are,

stellar system is stable, it is commonly assumed that such a mode will be
strongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than
redistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper
demonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may
persist long enough to have observable consequences. To do this, a method for
investigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for
locating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King
models of varying concentration. This leads to the following remarkable result:
King models exhibit {\it very} weakly damped $m=1$ modes over a wide range of
concentration ($0.67\le c\le1.5$ have been examined). The predicted damping
time is tens to hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density
to shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the
mode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible
astronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may
provide a natural explanation for observed discrepancies between density and
kinematic centers in galaxies, the location of velocity cusps due to massive
black holes, and $m=1$ disturbances of disks embedded in massive halos.
Gravitational shocking may excite the $m=1$ mode in globular clusters, which
could modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic
remnants.

the same footing. However, because second class constraints identically vanish
as operators in the quantum theory, they are quantum-mechanically reducible and
require therefore ghosts of ghosts. Otherwise, the BRST cohomology would not
yield the correct physical spectrum. We discuss how to incorporate this feature
in the formalism and show that it leads to an infinite tower of ghosts of

fermionic scalar superfields (which shifts $d_{critical}$ from (2,2) to (9,1)),

operator, picture-changing operators, and covariant vertex operators for the
Green-Schwarz superstring. Superstring scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary
number of loops and external massless states are then calculated by evaluating
correlation functions of these vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces,
and integrating over the N=2 super-moduli. These multiloop superstring
amplitudes have been proven to be SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e invariant (by
constructing the super-Poincar\'e generators and writing the amplitudes in
manifest SO(9,1) notation), unitary (by showing agreement with amplitudes
obtained using the light-cone gauge Green-Schwarz formalism), and finite (by
explicitly checking for divergences in the amplitudes when the Riemann surface
degenerates). There is no multiloop ambiguity in these Green-Schwarz scattering
amplitudes since spacetime-supersymmetry is manifest (there is no sum over spin
structures), and therefore the moduli space can be compactified.
