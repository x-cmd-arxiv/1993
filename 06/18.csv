"alg-geom/9306007",,"Olivier Debarre","Trisecant Lines And Jacobians, II","11 pages, PlainTex 1.2",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Let $\Theta$ be a symmetric theta divisor on an indecomposable principally
polarized complex abelian variety $X$. The linear system $|2\Theta |$ defines a
morphism $K:X\ra |2\Theta |^*$, whose image is the Kummer variety $K(X)$ of
$X$. When $(X,\theta)$ is the Jacobian of an algebraic curve, there are
infinitely many trisecants lines to $K(X)$. Welters has conjectured that the
existence of one trisecant line to the Kummer variety should characterize
Jacobians. The purpose of this article is to show the following weak version of
Welters conjecture: $X$ is a Jacobian if and only if there exist points $a,b,c$
of $X$ such that (i) the subgroup of $X$ generated by $a-b$ and $b-c$ is dense
in $X$, (ii) the points $K(a)$, $K(b)$ and $K(c)$ are distinct and collinear.
This improves on previous results obtained by the author (Trisecant Lines And
Jacobians, J. Alg. Geom. 1 (1992), 5--14). Various degenerate cases of the
conjecture are also considered.

the bright galaxy sample (BGS) and the deep high--galactic latitude sample,

overlap, however, our space densities are systematically lower by a factor of

same amount. Comparable results are obtained when comparing the far--IR LF of
our entire sample with the one derived from the BGS. This is not unexpected,
because of the bias towards high-luminosity spirals caused by selection at
60um.

star cluster astronomy can be studied in isolation: the influence of the Galaxy
affects dynamical evolution deep in the core, and the spectrum of stellar
masses; in turn the evolution of the core determines the highest stellar
densities, and the rate of encounters. In this way external tidal effects
indirectly influence the formation and evolution of blue stragglers, binary
pulsars, X-ray sources, etc. More controversially, the stellar density appears
to influence the relative distribution of normal stars. In the opposite sense,
the evolution of individual stars governs much of the early dynamics of a
globular cluster, and the existence of large numbers of primordial binary stars
has changed important details of our picture of the dynamical evolution. New
computational tools which will become available in the next few years will help
dynamical theorists to address these questions.

out that squark and slepton masses tend to be much larger than scalar masses
($m_{\phi} > 10 M_a$), which probably is a quite general fact. Experimental
bounds and the requirement of a successful electroweak breaking without fine
tuning impose further restrictions on the soft breaking terms. As a consequence
the gluino and chargino masses should be quite close to their present
