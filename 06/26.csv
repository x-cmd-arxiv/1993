Steenbrink on the cohomology of hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces.
Given a $d$-dimensional projective simplicial toric variety $P$ and an ample
hypersurface $X$ defined by an polynomial $f$ in the homogeneous coordinate
ring $S$ of $P$ (as defined in an earlier paper of the first author), we show
that the graded pieces of the Hodge filtration on $H^d(P - X)$ are naturally
isomorphic to certain graded pieces of $S/J(f)$, where $J(f)$ is the Jacobian
ideal of $f$. We then discuss how this relates to the primitive cohomology of
$X$. Also, if $T$ is the torus contained in $X$, then the intersection of $X$
and $T$ is an affine hypersurface in $T$, and we show how recent results of the
second author can be stated using various ideals in the ring $S$.
  To prove our results, we must give a careful description (in terms of $S$) of
$d$-forms and $(d-1)$-forms on the toric variety $P$. For completeness, we also
provide a proof of the Bott-Steenbrink-Danilov vanishing theorem for simplicial
toric varieties.
  Other topics considered in the paper include quasi-smooth hypersurfaces and
$V$-submanifolds, the structure of the complement of $U$ when $P$ is
represented as the quotient of an open subset $U$ of affine space, a
generalization of the Euler exact sequence on projective space, and the
relation between graded pieces of $R/J(f)$ and the moduli of ample
hypersurfaces in $P$.

computed by numerically solving the relativistic radiation transfer equations.
We find that the tensor contribution is significant only at large angular
scales (multipoles $\ell \lta 40$). For standard recombination, the tensor
contribution can dominate at $\ell \lta 40$; however, the effect would be
difficult to detect since the total (scalar plus tensor) polarization is $<
1$\%. For models with late reionization, the total large angular scale
polarization is large ($\sim 7-9$\%), but the tensor fraction is negligibly
small. Hence, polarization may be useful for discriminating ionization history,
but is much less promising as a means for detecting tensor fluctuations.

grand unified models possessing an $SU(5)$-type proton decay and $R$ parity are

scalar mass), $m_{1/2}$ (universal gaugino mass), $A_o$ (cubic soft breaking
parameter) and $\tan\beta=<H_2>/<H_1>$. Thus the 32 SUSY masses can be
expressed in terms of $m_o, m_{1/2}, A_o \tan\beta$ and the as yet unknown
t-quark mass $m_t$. Gut thresholds are examined and a simple model leads to
grand unification consistent with $p$-decay data when $0.114<\alpha_3
(M_z)<0.135$, in agreement with current values of $\alpha_3 (M_Z)$.Proton decay
is examined for the superheavy Higgs triplet mass $M_{H_3}<10M_G(M_G\simeq 1.5
\times10^{16}$~GeV) and squarks and gluinos lighter than 1 TeV. Throughout most
of the parameter space chargino-neutralino scaling relations are predicted to
hold: $2m_{\tilde{Z}_1}\cong m_{\tilde{W}_1}\cong m_{\tilde{Z}_2},
m_{\tilde{W}_1}\simeq(1/4)m_{\tilde{g}}$ (for $\mu>0$) or $m_{\tilde{W}_1}
\simeq(1/3)m_{\tilde{g}}$ (for $\mu<0$), while $m_{\tilde{W}_2}\cong
m_{\tilde{Z}_3}\cong m_{\tilde{Z}_4}>>m_{\tilde{Z}_1}$. Future proton decay
experiments combined with LEP2 lead to further predictions, e.g. for the entire
parameter space either proton decay should be seen at these or the$\tilde{W}_1$
seen at LEP2. Relic density constraints on the $\tilde{Z}_1$ further constrain
the parameter space e.g. so that $m_t<165$~GeV, $m_h<105$~GeV, $m_{\tilde{W}_1}
<100$~GeV and $m_{\tilde{Z}_1}<50$~GeV when $M_{H_3}/M_G < 6$. (Invited talk at
