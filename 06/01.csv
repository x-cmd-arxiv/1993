antiferromagnets in the long wavelength limit, via the nonlinear
$\sigma$-model. The mapping from the three-dimensional, integer spin Heisenberg
model to the nonlinear $\sigma$-model is explained, taking into account two
antiferromagnetic couplings: one along the chain axis ($J$) and one along the
perpendicular planes ($J_\bot$) of a cubic lattice. An implicit equation for
the Haldane gap is derived, as a function of temperature and coupling ratio
$J_\bot/J$. Solutions to these equations show the existence of a critical
coupling ratio beyond which a gap exists only above a transition temperature
$T_N$. The cut-off dependence of these results is discussed.

metric, in which the Wheeler--DeWitt operator is essentially self--adjoint.
This provides us with a kind of probabilistic interpretation. In particular,
giant wormholes will give extremely small contributions to any wormhole state.
We also study the whole spectrum of the Wheeler--DeWitt operator and its role
in the calculation of Green's functions and effective low energy interactions.

heavy quark symmetry. Furthermore, we show that heavy quark mass corrections
vanish at order $m^2/Q^2$ in QCD. There also exist higher twist corrections of

independently given on each connected component of the boundary and the

Ray-Singer conjecture \cite{RS} claims that for a closed manifold the
combinatorial and the analytic torsion norms on the determinant of the
cohomology are equal. For a manifold with boundary the ratio between the
analytic torsion and the combinatorial torsion is computed. Some new general
properties of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion are found. The proof does~not use
any computation of eigenvalues and its asymptotic expansions or explicit
expressions for the analytic torsions of any special classes of manifolds.

critical exponent for the chiral order parameter associated with the second
order chiral phase transition is shown to take the mean-field value together
