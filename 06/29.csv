adaptive predictors (predictive agents) responding to an evolving chaotic
environment and to one another. Our simulations are designed to quantify
adaptation and to explore co-adaptation for a simple calculable model of a
complex adaptive system. We first consider the ability of a single agent,
exposed to a chaotic environment, to model, control, and predict the future
states of that environment. We then introduce a second agent which, in
attempting to model and control both the chaotic environment and the first
agent, modifies the extent to which that agent can identify patterns and
exercise control. We find that (i) optimal adaptive predictors have an optimal
memory and an optimal complexity, which are small for a rapidly changing map
dynamics and (ii) that the predictive power can be increased by imposing chaos
or random noise onto the map dynamics. The competition between the two
predictive agents can lead either to chaos, or to metastable emergent behavior,
best described as a leader-follower relationship. Our results suggest a
correlation between optimal adaptation, optimal complexity, and emergent
behavior, and provide preliminary support for the concept of optimal
co-adaptation near the edge of chaos.

numerical magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the infinitely long cloud in
hydrostatic configuration, small perturbations grow by the gravitational
instability. The most unstable mode indicated by a linear perturbation theory
grows selectively even from a white noise. The growth rate agrees with that
calculated by the linear theory. First, the density-enhanced region has an
elongated shape, i.e., prolate spheroidal shape. As the collapse proceeds, the
high-density fragment begins to contract mainly along the symmetry axis.
Finally, a spherical core is formed in the non-magnetized cloud. In contrast,
an oblate spheroidal dense disk is formed in a cloud in which the magnetic
pressure is nearly equal to the thermal one. The radial size of the disk
becomes proportional to the initial characteristic density scale-height in the
r-direction. As the collapse proceeds, a slowly contracting dense part is
formed (approximately < 10% in mass) inside of the fast contracting disk. And
this is separated from other part of the disk whose inflow velocity is
accelerated as reaching the center of the core. From arguments on the Jeans
mass and the magnetic critical mass, it is concluded that the fragments formed
in a cylindrical elongated cloud can not be supported against the self- gravity
and it will eventually collapse.

incorporate degenerate metrics. This extension is not unique, however, as one
can change the form of the hamiltonian constraints and obtain an {\it
alternative} degenerate extension of general relativity that disagrees with
Ashtekar's original theory when the triads vectors are degenerate. In this
paper, the constraint algebra of a particular alternative theory is explicitly
evaluated and compared with that of Ashtekar's original degenerate extension. A
generic classification of the difference between the two theories is given in
terms of the degeneracy and surface-forming properties of the triad vectors.
(This classification is valid when the degeneracy and surface-forming
properties of the triad vectors is the same everywhere in an open set about a
point in space.) If the triad vectors are degenerate and surface-forming, then
all the secondary constraints of the alternative degenerate extension are
satisfied as a consequence of the primary constraints, and the constraints of
this theory are weaker than those of Ashtekar's. If the degenerate triad
vectors are not surface-forming, then the first secondary constraint of the
alternative theory already implies equivalence with Ashtekar's degenerate
extension. What happens when the degeneracy and surface-forming properties of
the triad vectors change from point to point is an open question.

neutralinos into a gluon and quark-antiquark pair, and discuss QCD corrections
to the tree-level cross sections for neutralino annihilation into quarks. If
the neutralino is lighter than the top quark, the effect of these results on
high-energy neutrino signals from neutralino annihilation in the Sun and in the
Earth can be significant, especially if the neutralino is primarily gaugino. On
the other hand, our results should have little effect on calculations of the
cosmological abundance of neutralinos. We also briefly discuss implications for
cosmic-ray antiprotons from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo.

based on a representation of discrete gravity in terms of random matrices. We
discuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class of
related $O(n)$ matrix models. For $d<1$ matter, the matrix problem can be
completely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonal
polynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomial
method can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations of
the canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In the
case of pure gravity or discrete Ising--like matter, the sum over topologies is
reduced to the solution of non-linear differential equations (the Painlev\'e
equation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an action
principle. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models,
the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does not
define a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model does
not define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also review
the computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulation
of matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results.
Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity,
and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space of
punctured Riemann surfaces.
