effective interaction term. The application of the equations of motion can be
realized by performing field transformations that involve derivatives of the
fields. Using the Hamiltonian formalism for higher order Lagrangians
(Ostrogradsky formalism), Lagrangians that are related by such transformations
are shown to be physically equivalent (at the classical and at the quantum
level). The equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian path integral
quantization (Matthews's theorem) is proven for effective higher order
Lagrangians. Effective interactions of massive vector fields involving higher
order derivatives are examined within gauge noninvariant models as well as
within (linearly or nonlinearly realized) spontaneously broken gauge theories.
The Stueckelberg formalism, which relates gauge noninvariant to gauge invariant
Lagrangians, becomes reformulated within the Ostrogradsky formalism.

If a model is based on an RCFT, its associated graph algebra is the fusion ring
of the RCFT. A number of examples are studied. The Gordon--generalized IRF
models are studied, and are shown to come from RCFT, by the graph algebra
construction. The IRF models based on the Dynkin diagrams of A-D-E are studied.
While the $A$ case stems from an RCFT, it is shown that the $D-E$ cases do not.
The graph algebras are constructed, and it is speculated that a natural
isomorphism relating these to RCFT exists. The question whether all solvable
IRF models stems from an RCFT remains open, though the $D-E$ cases shows that a
mixing of the primary fields is needed.

the antifields can be greatly simplified by using a theorem on the antibracket
cohomology. The latter is based on properties of a `Koszul--Tate differential',
namely its acyclicity and nilpotency. We present a new proof for this
acyclicity, respecting locality and covariance of the theory. This theorem then
implies that consistent higher ghost terms in various expressions exist, and it
avoids tedious calculations.
  This is illustrated in chiral $W_3$ gravity. We compute the one--loop anomaly
without terms of negative ghost number. Then the mentioned theorem and the
consistency condition imply that the full anomaly is determined up to local
counterterms. Finally we show how to implement background charges into the BV
language in order to cancel the anomaly with the appropriate counterterms.
Again we use the theorem to simplify the calculations, which agree with
previous results.
