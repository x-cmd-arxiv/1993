($n$-point) galaxy correlation functions in the mildly non-linear regime.
Several variations of the standard $\Omega=1$ cold dark matter model with
scale-invariant primordial perturbations have recently been introduced to
obtain more power on large scales, 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, e.g., low-matter-density
(non-zero cosmological constant) models, `tilted' primordial spectra, and
scenarios with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter. They also include models
with an effective scale-dependent bias, such as the cooperative galaxy
formation scenario of Bower, etal. (1993). We show that higher-order galaxy
correlation functions can provide a useful test of such models and can
discriminate between models with true large-scale power in the density field
and those where the galaxy power arises from scale-dependent bias: a bias with
rapid scale-dependence leads to a dramatic decrease of the hierarchical
amplitudes at large scales. Current observational constraints on the
three-point amplitudes $Q_3$ and $S_3$ can place limits on the bias
parameter(s) and appear to disfavor, but not yet rule out, the hypothesis that
scale-dependent bias is responsible for the extra power observed on large
scales.

antiferromagnet (HAF) on the triangular lattice with nearest-neighbour ($J$)
and next-nearest neighbour ($\alpha J$) couplings. Classically, this system is
known to be ordered in a $120^\circ$ N\'eel type state for values
$-\infty<\alpha\le 1/8$ of the ratio $\alpha$ of these couplings and in a
collinear state for $1/8<\alpha<1$. The order parameter ${\cal M}$ and the
helicity $\chi$ of the $120^\circ$ structure are obtained by numerical
diagonalisation of finite periodic systems of up to $N=30$ sites and by
applying the spin-wave (SW) approximation to the same finite systems. We find a
surprisingly good agreement between the exact and the SW results in the entire
region $-\infty<\alpha< 1/8$. It appears that the SW theory is still valid for
the simple triangular HAF ($\alpha=0$) although the sublattice magnetisation
${\cal M}$ is substantially reduced from its classical value by quantum
fluctuations. Our numerical results for the order parameter ${\cal N}$ of the
collinear order support the previous conjecture of a first order transition
between the $120^\circ$ and the collinear order at $\alpha \simeq 1/8$.

large ground state degeneracy, due to the symmetry generated by the total spin.
This symmetry is also responsible for degeneracies in the rest of the spectrum.
We discuss the global structure of the spectrum of Heisenberg models with
arbitrary couplings, using group theoretical methods. The Hilbert space breaks
up in blocks characterized by the quantum numbers of the total spin, $S$ and
$M$, and each block is shown to constitute the representation space of an
explicitly given irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_N$,
consisting of permutations of the $N$ spins in the system.
  In the second part of the paper we consider, as a concrete application, the
model where each spin is coupled to all the other spins with equal strength.
Its partition function is written as a single integral, elucidating its
$N$-dependence. This provides a useful framework for studying finite size
effects. We give explicit results for the heat capacity, revealing interesting
behavior just around the phase transition.

uniqueness of the standard second order Newton-Einstein classical gravitational

validity of Newton's Law of Gravity can actually be extended to distances much
larger than the solar system distance scales on which the law was originally
established. On the theoretical side we identify some commonly accepted but
actually still open to question assumptions which go into the formulating of
the standard second order Einstein theory in the first place. In particular, we
show that while the familiar second order Poisson gravitational equation (and
accordingly its second order covariant Einstein generalization) may be
sufficient to yield Newton's Law of Gravity they are not in fact necessary. The
standard theory thus still awaits the identification of some principle which
would then make it necessary too. We show that current observational
information does not exclusively mandate the standard theory, and that the
conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity considered recently by
Mannheim and Kazanas is also able to meet the constraints of data, and in fact
to do so without the need for any so far unobserved non-luminous or dark
matter.

The dilution factor depends on the saxino and axion masses, and is constrained
by the requirement that saxino decay should not affect nucleosynthesis, as well
as by the usual requirement that the axion density be less than the critical
density. The latter constraint is evaluated carefully, under both the
Harari-Sikivie and Davis proposals about the emission spectrum from axionic
strings. Uncertainties are carefully evaluated, points of principle are
addressed, and with an eye to future numerical simulation the spacing and
typical oscillation wavelength of the strings are represented by parameters
varying in the range 1 to 3. Within the constraints, the entropy dilution
varies from 1 to $10^{-4}$. Only saxinos originating from thermal equilibrium
are considered, so that more dilution might arise from non-thermal saxinos.

This enables us to calculate the elliptic genera for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds.

with $SU(N)$ holonomy we can compare the expressions with the ones obtained by
orbifoldizing tensor products of $N=2$ minimal models. We also give sigma model

$22<c_{\rm matter}<24$, the matter shock waves, whose energy momentum tensors
are given by $T_{\rm matter} \propto \delta(x^+ - x^+_0)$, create a kind of
wormholes, {\it i.e.,} causally disconnected regions. Most of the quantum
informations in past null infinity are lost in future null infinity but the
lost informations would be carried by the wormholes.
  We also discuss about the problem of defining the mass of quantum black
holes. On the basis of the argument by Regge and Teitelboim, we show that the
ADM mass measured by the observer who lives in one of asymptotically flat
regions is finite and does not vanish in general. On the other hand, the Bondi
mass is ill-defined in this model. Instead of the Bondi mass, we consider the
mass measured by observers who live in an asymptotically flat region at first.
A class of the observers finds the mass of the black hole created by a shock
wave changes as the observers' proper time goes by, i.e. they observe the
Hawking radiation. The measured mass vanishes after the infinite proper time
and the black hole evaporates completely. Therefore the total Hawking radiation
is positive even when $N<24$.
