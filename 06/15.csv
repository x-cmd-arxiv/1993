fields from the nonlinear redshift--space projected density field. The method
is based on the nonlinear, nonlocal transformation of the density field. We
assume a curl--free velocity field, although in the formulation presented here
this assumption can be dropped. Toy models with special symmetry are used to
test the intrinsic accuracy of the method compared to linear theory.
  Finding significant improvement we then test the method in more detail on
N--body simulations, considering the problems associated with sampling the
density field using sparse, magnitude--limited galaxy redshift surveys.
  A method of estimating the magnitude of shot--noise effects on the
deprojected velocity field is derived.
  We find there is a good correlation between the true and deprojected density
and velocity fields, even in the mildly nonlinear regime, provided that on
large scales galaxies trace the mass. An initial application is made to the
IRAS--QDOT all--sky redshift survey.

random from sample to sample and from point to point on the magnetic field axis
owing to random scattering of the electron trajectories by impurities within
the wires. We report experiments on new devices made with wet etching and
global gates, which have shown major progress towards removing the random
features. In loops that exhibit ballistic conductance plateaux and cyclotron
orbit trapping at $4.2K$, the random pattern of AB oscillations (observed for
$T < 0.1K$) can be replaced by much more ordered one -- especially if only a
few transverse modes are populated in the ring. The amplitude and shape of the
oscillation envelope function change systematically as subbands are populated
in the wires forming the loops. Mechanisms governing the AB effect in the
ballistic regime are discussed. Correlation has been found between the
$G(V_{g},B=0)$ staircase and the ``beating period"" of the envelope functions.
Quantum oscillations in $G(V_{g},B = 0)$ are consistent with direct
interference of paths of unequal length. Both the correlations and the quantum
