found fault with the theory of impure superconductors by Abrikosov and Gor'kov
and have proposed an alternative formalism based on Green's functions which are
not derivable from a Dyson equation. Although the corrections to the
Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory found by Kim and Overhauser are correct for
non-retarded interactions, I argue that these corrections do not appear when
one treats realistic retarded interactions within the field-theoretic approach
of Abrikosov and Gor'kov. Direct numerical computation of the impurity-induced
suppression of the superconducting transition temperature Tc for both retarded
and non-retarded interactions illustrates these points. I conclude that
Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory applied to physical electron-electron interactions
yields a tractable formalism which accurately predicts the effects of magnetic
and non-magnetic impurities on Tc.

the matter induced decay can be a plausible candidate for the explanation of
solar neutrino deficit, provided that there exist new flavour-changing weak

naturally implies the hierarchy between the ratios Z=(measured signal)/(SSM

Gr\""obner bases is used both to find the conditions on $f(u)$ under which
symmetries other than the trivial spatial and temporal translational symmetries
exist, and to solve the determining equations for the infinitesimals. A
catalogue of symmetry reductions is given including some new reductions for the
linear heat equation and a catalogue of exact solutions of (1) for cubic $f(u)$
in terms of the roots of $f(u)=0$.
