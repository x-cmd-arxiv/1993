that of a rapid supercooling in which the system is trapped in a metastable
state at a temperature larger than the mass of the quanta, but smaller than the
energy to create a critical droplet. The initial density matrix is evolved in
time and the nucleation rate (probability current at the saddle point) is
computed. The nucleation rate is {\it time dependent}, vanishing at early
times, reaching a maximum at a time $t \approx 1/m$ with $m$ the mass of quanta
in the metastable state, and decreasing at long times as a consequence of
unitarity. An estimate for the average number of particles of ``true vacuum''
produced as a function of time during the nucleation process is obtained.

Particular attention is paid to the interval of definition of the statistical

that at the critical filling $\nu=-{1/\alpha}$ where the pressure diverges, the
external magnetic field is entirely screened by the flux tubes carried by the
