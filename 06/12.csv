we review work by Langton \cite{Langton90} and Packard \cite{Packard88} on the
relationship between dynamical behavior and computational capability in
cellular automata (CA). We present results from an experiment similar to the
one described in \cite{Packard88}, that was cited there as evidence for the
hypothesis that rules capable of performing complex computations are most
likely to be found at a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioral
regimes for CA (the ``edge of chaos''). Our experiment produced very different
results from the original experiment, and we suggest that the interpretation of
the original results is not correct. We conclude by discussing general issues
related to dynamics, computation, and the ``edge of chaos'' in cellular
automata.

(VPF), we investigate the statistical properties of voids within a wide range
of initially Gaussian models for the origin of large-scale structure. We pay
particular attention to the ability of the VPF to diagnose `biased galaxy
formation': the preferential formation of galaxies in regions of high
background density and corresponding suppression of galaxy formation in regions
of low background density. Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than
unbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively
insensitive to the value of the bias factor $b$. Thus, while the VPF can
distinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a
useful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate
choice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on $b$. We compare
the predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published
to date. These data do {\it not} require strong biasing; Gaussian models in
which galaxies trace mass can reproduce the VPF data to within the errors
expected from the current finite volume fluctuations. Models with the moderate
biasing predicted by cosmological simulations with gas dynamics yield a
slightly better match to the data. Models in which galaxy formation is strongly
suppressed in low density regions produce an excess of large, empty voids.

exceeding 0.01. A few percent of their luminosity is scattered and appears as
diffuse polarized emission. We calculate the scattering process for different
geometric combinations of luminosity sources and scattering media. We apply our
results to galaxies, with and without active nuclei, immersed in cooling flows.
We model observations of NGC 1275 and M87 (without active nuclei) in the
presence of sky and galactic background fluxes which hinder the measurement of
the scattered light at optical wavelengths. Current instruments are unable to
detect the scattered light from such objects. However, when a galaxy has an
active nucleus of roughly the same luminosity as the remainder of the galaxy in
V, both the total and polarized scattered intensity should observable on large
scales (5--30kpc), meaning intensity levels greater than 1% of the background
level. For typical AGN and galaxy spectral distributions, the scattering is
most easily detected at short (U) wavelengths. We point out that a number of
such cases will occur. We show that the radiation pattern from the central
nuclear region can be mapped using the scattering. We also show that the
scattered light can be used to measure inhomogeneities in the cooling flow.

lattices at $\beta=6.3$ through a procedure that interpolates between the
static approximation of Eichten and the conventional (""heavy"" Wilson fermion)
method. The previously observed discrepancy between these two approaches has
been resolved: we find the scaling quantity $f\sqrt{M}$ to be significantly
smaller than previous calculations had indicated ({\it e.g.} at $\beta=6.0$);
in addition, we discuss a modification which is required in normalizing the
conventional amplitude to correct for large-$am$ lattice errors. This change
guarantees that $f\sqrt{M}$ will smoothly approach its value in the static
limit. From the numerical interpolation of the static and intermediate-mass
results, we find, in units of MeV, $f_B=187(10)\pm34\pm15$,
$f_{B_s}=207(9)\pm34\pm22$, $f_D=208(9)\pm35\pm12$ and
$f_{D_s}=230(7)\pm30\pm18$, where the first error is statistical and the second
two are estimates of systematics due to 1) fitting and large-$am$ effects and
2) scaling. In addition, using lattices at $\beta=6.3$, $\beta=6.0$ and
$\beta=5.7$ and extrapolating to the limit of zero lattice spacing, we have
computed $f_K/f_\pi = 1.08\pm.03\pm.08$ in the quenched approximation.

an example, we consider simple field theories in which an $O(N)$ symmetry
spontaneously breaks to $O(N-1)$. We show that in these theories Weinberg's
criterion for a natural effective theory may be applied directly to the
$S$-matrix; it implies that the scale of new physics, beyond the Goldstone
bosons, may not be too large: there is always a particle or a cut of mass below

expansion of the chiral Lagrangian. It appears to be impossible to construct an

study of the extent to which the interior of a region in a symplectic manifold
determines its boundary. We prove, by a simple geometric argument, that both
versions of energy give rise to genuine norms on all symplectic manifolds.
Roughly speaking, we show that if there were a symplectomorphism of $M$ which
had ""too little"" energy, one could embed a large ball into a thin cylinder $M
\times B^2$. Thus there is a direct geometric relation between symplectic
rigidity and energy.

theorem for an arbitrary manifold $M$. We do not need to restrict to manifolds
