nature of the defects allows simpler analytic and numerical methods. We find
that, at least for $\sigma > 1$, the model exhibits evolution to a self-similar
state characterized by a length scale which grows with time as
$t^{1/(1+\sigma)}$, and that the late time dynamics is independent of the
initial length scale. The insensitivity of the dynamics to the initial

renormalization group fixed point which governs the late time behavior. For
$\sigma \le 1$ we find indications in both the simulations and an analytic

$2\Delta$ is assumed between two energy levels. The fourfold degenerate
