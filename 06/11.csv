locally acting organisms is proposed in which organisms move probabilistically
between local cells in space, but with weights dependent on local morphogenetic
substances, or morphogens. The morphogens are in turn are effected by the
passage of an organism. The evolution of the morphogens, and the corresponding
flow of the organisms constitutes the collective behavior of the group. Such
models have various types of phase transitions and self-organizing properties
controlled both by the level of the noise, and other parameters.
  The model is then applied to the specific case of ants moving on a lattice.
The local behavior of the ants is inspired by the actual behavior observed in
the laboratory, and analytic results for the collective behavior are compared
to the corresponding laboratory results.
  It is hoped that the present model might serve as a paradigmatic example of a
complex cooperative system in nature. In particular swarm models can be used to
explore the relation of nonequilibrium phase transitions to at least three
important issues encountered in artificial life. Firstly, that of emergence as
complex adaptive behavior. Secondly, as an exploration of continuous phase
transitions in biological systems. Lastly, to derive behavioral criteria for
the evolution of collective behavior in social organisms.

Compton Gamma Ray Observatory show that a powerful cosmic accelerator must be
operating. In this paper the evidence for proton acceleration is collected with
the result that (i) the gamma ray spectrum should flatten slightly above a few
GeV and that (ii) high energy neutrinos from the decay of photomesons are
difficult to observe, although the power carried by these particles is as large
as the gamma ray power. However, the power is concentrated at energies in the
EeV range, whereas in the TeV-PeV range neutrinos from pp and p$\alpha$
collisions dominate due to their steeper spectrum. Consequently, the flux of
cosmic neutrinos from flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C273 in the energy
range relevant for proposed underwater or underice detectors could be much
lower than inferred from assuming the same spectrum for gamma rays and
neutrinos.

D - d - 2$. These solutions display a spacetime singularity surrounded by an
event horizon, and are characterized by a mass per unit $\tilde p$-volume,
${\cal M}_{\tilde{d}}$, and topological ``magnetic'' charge $g_{\tilde{d}}$,
obeying $\kappa {\cal M}_{\tilde{d}} \geq g_{\tilde{d}}/ \sqrt{2}$. In the
extreme limit $\kappa {\cal M}_{\tilde{d}}=g_{\tilde{d}}/ \sqrt{2}$, the
singularity and event horizon coalesce. For specific values of $D$~and~$d$,
these extreme solutions also exhibit supersymmetry and may be identified with
previously classified heterotic, Type IIA and Type IIB super $\tilde p$-branes.
The theory also admits elementary $p$-brane solutions with ``electric'' Noether
charge $e_d$, obeying the Dirac quantization rule $e_d g_{\tilde{d}} = 2\pi n$,
$n =$~integer. We also present the Lagrangian describing the theory dual to the
original theory, whose antisymmetric tensor has rank $\tilde{d}$ and for which
the roles of topological and elementary solutions are interchanged. The super
$p$-branes and their duals are mutually non-singular. As special cases of our
general solution we recover the black $p$-branes of Horowitz and Strominger $(D
= 10)$, Guven $(D = 11)$ and Gibbons et al $(D = 4)$, the $N = 1$, $N =

Recently, a stronger version of Levinson's theorem has been proven in which the
value of the positive- and negative-energy phase shifts are separately
constrained by the number of bound states of an appropriate set of
Schr\""odinger-like equations. In this work we elaborate on these ideas and show
that the stronger form of Levinson's theorem relates the individual phase
shifts directly to the number of bound states of the Dirac equation having an
even or odd number of nodes. We use a mean-field approximation to Walecka's
scalar-vector model to illustrate this stronger form of Levinson's theorem. We
show that the assignment of bound states to a particular phase shift should be
done, not on the basis of the sign of the bound-state energy, but rather, in
terms of the nodal structure (even/odd number of nodes) of the bound state.
