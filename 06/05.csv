quenched QCD to include theories in which only some of the quarks are quenched.
We discuss the relationship between the partially quenched theory and a theory
in which only the unquenched quarks are present. We also investigate the
peculiar infrared divergences associated with the $\eta'$ in the quenched
approximation, and find the conditions under which such divergences can appear
in a partially quenched theory. We then apply our results to staggered fermion
QCD in which the square root of the fermion determinant is taken, using the
observation that this should correspond to a theory with four quarks, two of
which are quenched. [Uses harvmac macro package. No postscipt for the figures

We work out the predictions for all sparticle and Higgs masses and discuss the
prospects for their detection at the Tevatron, LEPI,II, and HERA. We find that
the cosmological neutralino relic density is always within current expectations
(\ie, $\Omega_\chi h^2_0\lsim0.9$). We also consider a more constrained version
of this supersymmetry breaking scenario where the $B$-term is specified. In
this case $\tan\beta$ can be determined ($\tan\beta\approx1.4-1.6$) and implies
$m_t\lsim155\GeV$ and $m_h\lsim91\GeV$. Thus, continuing Tevatron top-quark
searches and LEPI,II Higgs searches could probe this restricted scenario
completely.

model to derive its form factors and ground state energy. This information is
then used in the limit $n\to0$ to obtain quantitative results for various
universal properties of self-avoiding chains and loops. In particular, we give
the first theoretical prediction of the amplitude ratio $C/D$ which relates the
mean square end-to-end distance of chains to the mean square radius of gyration
of closed loops. This agrees with the results from lattice enumeration studies
to within their errors, and gives strong support for the various assumptions
which enter into the field theoretic derivation. In addition, we obtain results
for the scaling function of the structure factor of long loops, and for various
amplitude ratios measuring the shape of self-avoiding chains. These quantities
are all related to moments of correlation functions which are evaluated as a
sum over $m$-particle intermediate states in the corresponding field theory. We
show that in almost all cases, the restriction to $m\leq2$ gives results which
are accurate to at least one part in $10^3$. This remarkable fact is traced to
a softening of the $m>2$ branch cuts relative to their behaviour based on phase
space arguments alone, a result which follows from the threshold behaviour of
the two-body $S$-matrix, $S(0)=-1$. Since this is a general property of
interacting 2d field theories, it suggests that similar approximations may well
hold for other models. However, we also study the moments of the area of
self-avoiding loops,
