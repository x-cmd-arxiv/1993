  Physical Review E, Submitted December 92, Revised June 93",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.48.4823",,"comp-gas nlin.CG",,"  A new approach of implementing initial and boundary conditions for the
lattice Boltzmann method is presented. The new approach is based on an extended
collision operator that uses the gradients of the fluid velocity. The numerical
performance of the lattice Boltzmann method is tested on several problems with
exact solutions and is also compared to an explicit finite difference
projection method. The discretization error of the lattice Boltzmann method
decreases quadratically with finer resolution both in space and in time. The
roundoff error of the lattice Boltzmann method creates problems unless double
precision arithmetic is used.

nature of a cholesteric liquid crystal. This model, for instance, would
describe the liquid of screw dislocations in the twist-grain-boundary (TGB)
phase of liquid crystals. We show that the presence of lines does not alter the
long wavelength elasticity of a cholesteric and, therefore, does not stabilize
Landau-Peierls instability of the cholesteric phase. We discuss other possible
mechanisms for stabilizing the twist-grain-boundary phase.

  latex, Alberta Thy-29-93","Phys.Rev. D48 (1993) 5250-5258","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.5250",,"hep-ph",,"  We present complete one-loop radiative corrections to the decay rate of a top
quark into a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark, and for the decay of a
charged Higgs boson into leptons. The results are discussed in the framework of
the two Higgs boson extension of the Standard Model suggested by supersymmetry.
The effect of electroweak corrections after exclusion of universal corrections
$\Delta r$ is found to decrease the partial width of the top quark typically by
5%.

charged scalar exchange. These phases affect CP asymmetries in neutral $B$
decays, even if Natural Flavor Conservation holds. The recent upper bound on
the decay $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ constrains the effect to be at most of order a
few percent. Modifications of constraints on the CKM parameters open an
interesting new region in the $\sin2\alpha-\sin2\beta$ plane even in the
absence of new phases.
