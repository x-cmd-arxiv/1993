naturally account for the features observed in Gamma-ray Burst spectra. The
source distribution, however, appears to be extragalactic. Although
noncatastrophic isotropic emission mechanisms may be ruled out on energetic and
timing arguments, MHD processes can produce strongly anisotropic gamma-rays
with an observable flux out to distances of around 1-2 Gpc. Here we show that
sheared Alfven waves propagating along open magnetospheric field lines at the
poles of magnetized neutron stars transfer their energy dissipationally to the
current sustaining the field misalignment and thereby focus their power into a
spatial region around 1000 times smaller than that of the crustal disturbance.
This produces a strong (observable) flux enhancement along certain directions.
We apply this model to a source population of ``turned-off'' pulsars that have
nonetheless retained their strong magnetic fields and have achieved alignment
at a period of greater than 5 seconds.

states gamma_1, gamma_2, and gamma_3) include the occasional appearance of a
strong ~ MeV bump (gamma_1), whose strength appears to be anti-correlated with
the continuum flux (~ 400 keV) due to the Compton upscattering of cold disk
photons by the inner, hot corona. We develop a self-consistent disk picture
that accounts naturally for these transitions and their corresponding spectral
variations. We argue that the bump is due to the self-Comptonization of
bremsstrahlung photons emitted predominantly near the plane of the corona
itself. Our results suggest that a decrease by a factor of approx 2 in the
viscosity parameter alpha is responsible for quenching this bump and driving
the system to the gamma_2 state, whereas a transition from gamma_2 to gamma_3
appears to be induced by an increase of about 25 % in the accretion rate Mdot.
In view of the fact that most of the transitions observed in this source seem
to be of the gamma_2 to gamma_3 variety, we conclude that much of the long term
gamma-ray spectral variability in Cygnus X-1 is due to these small fluctuations
in Mdot. The unusual appearance of the gamma_1 state apparently reflects a
change in the dissipative processes within the disk.

a 2-D asymmetric lattice gas model having tunable field mixing properties.
Monte Carlo simulations within the grand canonical ensemble are used to obtain
the critical density distribution for different degrees of particle-hole
asymmetry. Except in the special case when this asymmetry vanishes, the density
distributions exhibit an antisymmetric correction to the limiting
scale-invariant form. The presence of this correction reflects the mixing of
the critical energy density into the ordering operator. Its functional form is
found to be in excellent agreement with that predicted by the mixed-field
finite-size-scaling theory of Bruce and Wilding. A computational procedure for
measuring the significant field mixing parameter is also described, and its
accuracy gauged by comparing the results with exact values obtained

be confirmed at the $1\sigma$ level and estimates of the spin content of the

the three experiments comes out to be $0.41\pm0.05$ (to be compared with the
naive quark model theoretical expectation of 0.58) this experimental average
value is more than one standard deviation from the value obtained from any
individual experiment.This inconsistency can be overcome by allowing arbitrary
higher twist contributions but the resulting precision is poor, $\Delta q =
0.38\pm 0.48$.
