NGC 362. A V band surface brightness profile (SBP) was constructed from CCD
images, and, after it was determined that the cluster is not post
core-collapse, fit with single- and multi-mass King-Michie (KM) models. The
total cluster luminosity is 1.70 $\pm 0.1 \times 10^5$ L$_V$\sol. A total of
285 stellar spectra were obtained of 215 stars for radial velocity
determinations. Four stars showed strong evidence for radial velocity
variations and are probably members of binary systems. The true cluster binary
fraction was determined from simulations to be 0.15 for circular orbits or 0.27
for orbits with a distribution function $f(e) = e$ ($e$ is eccentricity). This
relatively high binary detection frequency may indicate that NGC 362 is
overabundant in binaries compared to other clusters. The 208 remaining stars
showed no sign of rotation. The best agreement with both the kinematic data and
the SBP were for shallow mass functions $x = 0.0 - 0.5$ and intermediate
amounts of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor. The cluster mass is M
= $2.5 - 3.5 \times 10^5$ M\sol\ for a global mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ =
1.5 - 2.0 M\sol/L$_V$\sol. This low value for $x$ is in disagreement with the
correlation between $x$ and the height above the Galactic disk seen for a
sample of other clusters. The results are also different from the sharp turn-up
in the low mass end of mass functions derived from some deep luminosity
functions of three other globular clusters.

we obtain a very accurate estimate for the ratio $\alpha/\nu$ of the

theory beneath the GUT scale is the two-Higgs MSSM. If we further assume that
the unified gauge group contains SO(10), that the two light Higgs doublets lie
mostly in a single irreducible SO(10) representation, and that the $t$, $b$ and
$\tau$ masses originate in renormalizable Yukawa interactions of the form $16_3
O 16_3$, then also the top quark mass can be predicted in terms of the MSSM
parameters. To compute $m_t$ we present a precise analytic approximation to the
solution of the 2-loop renormalization group equations, and study
supersymmetric and GUT threshold corrections and the input value of the $b$
quark mass. The large ratio of top to bottom quark masses derives from a large
ratio, $\tan\beta$, of Higgs vacuum expectation values. We point out that when
$\tan\beta$ is large, so are certain corrections to the $b$ quark mass
prediction, unless a particular hierarchy exists in the parameters of the
model. With such a hierarchy, which may result from approximate symmetries, the
top mass prediction depends only weakly on the spectrum. Our results may be
applied to any supersymmetric SO(10)-like model as long as $\lambda_t\simeq
\lambda_b\simeq\lambda_\tau$ at the GUT scale and there are no intermediate
mass scales in the desert.

explicitly derived from these solutions with Heisenberg picture method and
thereby the meaning of the wavefunction governed by it is clarified by
analyzing the effect of the Brownian motion. Especially, the general effective

method for the case when the Brownian motion can be ignored. Using this
effective Hamiltonian, we show an interesting fact that the dissipation
