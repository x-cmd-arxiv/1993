  of Cosmological Power Spectra","16 pages, tex, UNLV/93/32",,"10.1086/174252",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose the zero-point of the cluster-cluster correlation function as a
sensitive test for the shape of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations. It
is now possible to go beyond the power law description to measure the point at
which the correlation function becomes zero. Four independent measurements
indicate that the zero point, $r_0$, should be in the range (40-60)$h^{-1}$Mpc.
The large value of $r_0$ at which the zero-point occurs rules out conventional
CDM models independently of the assumed amplitude. Models with $\Omega < 0.25$
should be rejected because they predict too large $r_0$. If the age of the
Universe is assumed to be larger than 15 Gyr, models with either $\Omega<0.5$
or $h> 0.55$ are rejected. We present the results of numerical simulations of
clusters in an $\Omega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of cold plus hot
dark matter (CHDM). The correlation function we determined for the simulated
clusters has a zero-point, $r_0=55h^{-1}$Mpc that accurately matches the zero
point of the observed function.

Monte Carlo data we determine the universal conductivity $\sigma^*$ and the
critical exponents at the transition. The result $\sigma^* = (0.55 \pm 0.06)

chirality. We discuss two $Z_2$ and three $Z_3$ nonequivalent cases. Among the

for coupling to topological open strings. The targets are Kahler manifolds with
a real structure, i.e. with an involution acting as a complex conjugation,
compatible with the Kahler metric. These models satisfy axioms of what might be
called ``equivariant topological quantum field theory,'' generalizing the
axioms of topological field theory as given by Atiyah. Observables of the
equivariant topological sigma models correspond to cohomological classes in an
equivariant cohomology theory of the targets. Their correlation functions can
be computed, leading to intersection theory on instanton moduli spaces with a
natural real structure. An equivariant $CP^1\times CP^1$ model is discussed in
detail, and solved explicitly. Finally, we discuss the equivariant formulation
of topological gravity on surfaces of unoriented open and closed string theory,
and find a $Z_2$ anomaly explaining some problems with the formulation of
topological open string theory.

microscopic cluster model. This model gives a reasonably good description for
all the subsystems of $^6$He and $^6$Li in a coherent way, without any free
parameter. The beta decay transition probability to the $^6$Li ground state is
underestimated by a few percents. The theoretical beta delayed deuteron
spectrum is close to experiment but it is also underestimated by about a factor
1.7. We argue that, in spite of their different magnitudes, both
underestimations might have a common origin. The model confirms that the
neutron halo part of the $^6$He wave function plays a crucial role in quenching
the beta decay toward the $\alpha$ + d channel.
