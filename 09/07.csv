deconfined phases by the histogram method in SU(3) lattice gauge theory for
temporal extents of 4 and 6 using the recent high-statistics data by QCDPAX
collaboration. The results are $\sigma/T_c^3 = 0.0292(22)$ and 0.0218(33) for
$N_t=4$ and 6, respectively. The ratio $\sigma/T_c^3$ shows a scaling violation
similar to that already observed for the latent heat $\latent$. However, we
find that the physically interesting dimensionless combinations
$(\sigma^{3}/\latent^2 T)^{1/2}$ and $\sigma T/ \latent$ scale within the
statistical errors.

matrix elements since it is an incomparable tool to check the models and
methods applied to extract $V_{bu}$ from $B$ decay partial widths.
  We report on some recent proposals to improve on parton model. Turning to
exclusive decays, we compare the predictions from quark models, QCD sum rules,
effective Lagrangians and lattice QCD. Quark models have anticipated on heavy
quark symmetry. Their difficutly to account for the $q^2$ dependence might be
partly cured by relativistic corrections. QCD sum rules and lattice seem to
disagree on the $q^2$ dependence of axial form factors. We discuss the
extrapolation from $D$ to $B$. Present uncertainties do not allow to predict
reliably the $B\ra\pi,\rho l \nu$ matrix elements. We argue that QCD sum rules
are in a good position to study $q^2$ dependence down to $q^2=0$. Lattice QCD
is able to check the heavy quark scaling laws for the heavy to light
semileptonic decays. It seems to confirm the increase of $A_2/A_1$ from $D$ to
$B$ meson predicted by the scaling laws. Finally semileptonic decays in a TCF
would give incomparable informations on $K\pi$ phase shifts, and on $K^{**}$
resonances.

be large if and only if the top mass is larger than $2v$ so that the cutoff
scale is of the order of the electroweak scale. These non--universal effects
are the reflections at low energies of the physics beyond the supersymmetric

revealed between the two sets of potentials, most notably in the description by

the odd-parity component is of greater radial extent. Comparison with

Reasonable agreement is found with a previous relativistic calculation of the

inelastic electron scattering effects of final state interactions and
relativistic corrections to the structure functions are considered in the
