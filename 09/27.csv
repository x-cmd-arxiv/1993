the L1495 cloud centered on the well known weak line T Tauri star (WTTS) V410
Tau using the ROSAT PSPC. This deep exposure enabled a search for candidate
pre-main sequence (PMS) objects in this cloud to a limit 20 times more
sensitive than that typical of the fields examined with the Einstein searches.
Despite assertions that the PMS population in Taurus-Auriga is nearly
completely known, this x-ray survey revealed 8 new PMS objects in a region 50'
in diameter, as compared to a previously known stellar population of 12
objects, including deeply embedded IRAS sources. Spectroscopic and photometric
observations enable us to place these objects in the HR Diagram. The newly
discovered objects are predominantly stars of spectral type M0 and later, and a
large fraction (6/8) appear to be surrounded by circumstellar accretion disks
as judged by their infrared excess and H alpha emission. We combined the data
for these x-ray discovered objects with extant and new data for the previously
identified PMS stars in this region to examine the history of star formation
and the frequency distribution of stellar masses in this cloud. If the ``post
ROSAT'' population is either complete or representative, we conclude (1) that
star formation in L1495 East took place 1 x 10^6 yrs ago and that the spread in
ages is small; (2) the frequency distribution of masses,

the quark baryon density in the vicinity of a fixed test quark at high

temperature, suggesting that small color singlet clusters are unimportant in
the thermal ensemble. We also find that at $T = 0.75\ T_c$ the total induced
quark number shows a surprisingly large component attributable to baryonic
screening. A companion simulation of a simple flux tube model produces similar
results and also suggests a plausible phenomenological scenario: As the
crossover temperature is approached from below, baryonic states proliferate.
Above the crossover temperature the mean size of color singlet clusters grows
explosively, resulting in an effective electrostatic deconfinement.

possible functional relations for models associated with all the simple Lie

point of Hawking evaporation is two disconnected remnants of infinite extent,

$N=2$ theories with $\hat c=3$ (i.e. the critical case). An important
ingredient is the discovery of an anomaly at every genus in decoupling of BRST
trivial states, captured to all orders by a master anomaly equation. In a
particular realization of the $N=2$ theories, the resulting string field theory
is equivalent to a topological theory in six dimensions, the Kodaira--Spencer
theory, which may be viewed as the closed string analog of the Chern--Simon
theory. Using the mirror map this leads to computation of the `number' of
holomorphic curves of higher genus curves in Calabi--Yau manifolds. It is shown
that topological amplitudes can also be reinterpreted as computing corrections
to superpotential terms appearing in the effective 4d theory resulting from
compactification of standard 10d superstrings on the corresponding $N=2$
theory. Relations with $c=1$ strings are also pointed out.

with the set of constraints, we introduce the electro- magnetic interaction of
a charged anyon and obtain the Lagrangian. The Casimir operator of the extended
algebra, which is the first-class constraint, is obtained and gives the
equation of motion of the anyon. In particular, from the latter it follows that
the gyromagnetic ratio for a charged anyon is two due to the parallelness of
spin and momentum of the particle in 2+1 dimensions. The canonical quantization
is also considered in this case.
