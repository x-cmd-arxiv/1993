  HUJI-AST-002) (Also available by anonymous ftp from alf.huji.ac.il as
  pub/dekel/reviews/iap93.ps.Z of 0.44Mbyte)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The large-scale dynamics of matter is inferred from the observed peculiar
velocities of galaxies via the POTENT procedure. The smoothed fields of
velocity and mass-density fluctuations are recovered from the current data of
about 3000 galaxies. The cosmological density parameter Omega can then be
constrained in three ways: (a) by comparing the density fields of mass and
galaxies, (b) by using the velocity field in voids, and (c) by investigating
quasilinear deviations from Gaussian fluctuations. The results indicate a high
value of Omega near unity; values in the range 0.1-0.3 are rejected with high
confidence.

are analysed. It is shown that, for backgrounds generated from compact WZW and
coset models, such duality symmetries are exact to all orders in string
perturbation theory. A global treatment of duality symmetries is given, by
associating them to the known symmetries of affine current algebras
(affine-Weyl group and external automorphisms). It is argued that self-duality
symmetries of WZW and coset models generate the duality symmetries of their
moduli space. Some remarks are presented, concerning the survival of such
symmetries in the non-compact case. The implications of duality symmetries for
string dynamics in non-trivial/singular spacetimes are discussed. (Talk given
at the ""Strings 93"" Conference at Berkeley, May 1993)

of Broda and (up to an unspecified normalization factor) the state-sum
invariant arising from the TQFT of Crane-Yetter are equivalent to the signature
of the 4-manifold. Subsequently Broda defined another surgical invariant in
which the 1- and 2-handles are treated differently. We use a refinement of
Roberts' techniques developped by the authors in hep-th/9309063 to show that
the ""improved"" surgical invariant of Broda also depends only on the signature

term by modifying two terms of the usual Lagrangian. We multiply a dielectric
function with the Maxwell kinetic energy term and incorporate nonminimal
interaction by considering generalized covariant derivative. We show that for a
particular choice of the dielectric function this model admits topological
vortices satisfying Bogomol'nyi bound for which the magnetic flux is not
quantized even though the energy is quantized. Furthermore, the vortex solution
in each topological sector is infinitely degenerate.
