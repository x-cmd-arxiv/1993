random phase approximation. It is found that the extended $s$ and the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-channels are {\em not} degenerate near half filling. Extended
$s$-pairing with a low $T_c$ occurs only for a band containing less then 0.4
electrons or holes per unit cell, whereas in a large region around half-filling
$d$-wave pairing is the only stable superconducting solution. At half filling
superconductivity is suppressed due to the formation of the anti-ferromagnetic
Mott-Hubbard insulating state. By extending the analysis to the unconstrained
$t-t'-J$ model, it is proven that, if a Fermi surface is assumed similar to the
one that is known to exist in cuprous oxide superconductors, the highest
superconducting $T_c$ is reached for about $0.7$ electron per site, whereas the
anti-ferromagnetic solution still occurs for $1$ electron per site. It is
shown, that the maximum $d$-wave superconducting mean field transition
temperature is half the maximum value that the Ne\`el temperature can have in
the Mott-insulating state.

condensates. Our result indicates that there might be no hierarchy of power
corrections in finite energy sum rules at the scale of $\tau$ mass. Therefore,
the standard nonperturbative corrections do not necessarily improve the
accuracy of the theoretical predicition, but can rather be used to estimate an
intrinsic accuracy of the pure perturbative calculation, which turns out to be
rather high on this evidence, of order one percent.

the solution is found for both $X^0 \to 0$ and $X^0 \to \infty$ and we plot the
numerical solution for all times. Right after the big bang ($X^0 = 0$), the
string energy decreasess as $ R(X^0)^{-1} $ and the string size grows as $
R(X^0) $ for $ 0 < \a < 1 $ and as $ X^0 $ for $ \a < 0 $ and $ \a > 1 $. Very
soon [ $ X^0 \sim 1 $] , the ring reaches its oscillatory regime with frequency
equal to the winding and constant size and energy. This picture holds for all
values of $ \a $ including string vacua (for which, asymptotically, $ \a = 1$).
In addition, an exact non-oscillatory ring solution is found. For black hole
spacetimes (Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\oo m and stringy), we solve for
ring strings moving towards the center. Depending on their initial conditions
(essentially the oscillation phase), they are are absorbed or not by
Schwarzschild black holes. The phenomenon of particle transmutation is
explicitly observed (for rings not swallowed by the hole). An effective horizon
is noticed for the rings. Exact and explicit ring solutions inside the
horizon(s) are found. They may be interpreted as strings propagating between
the different universes described by the full black hole manifold.

system of coupled saddle-point equations we effectively sum all tree-graphs
contributing to the one-point Green's function of the meson field in the
background of a rotating soliton. We find that the resulting one-point function
evaluated between soliton states of definite $U(1)$ charge exhibits a pole on
the meson mass shell and we extract the corresponding S-matrix element for the
decay of an excited state via the emission of a single meson using the standard
LSZ reduction formula. This S-matrix element has a natural interpretation in
terms of an effective Lagrangian for the charged soliton states with an
explicit Yukawa coupling to the meson field. We calculate the leading-order
