density profile and shape of the dark halo. Gas dissipates energy radiatively
and sinks to the center of the dark halo forming the luminous part of a galaxy.
The resulting central density enhancement can alter the halo's orbital
distribution. We simulate dissipative infall inside of an initially triaxial
N-body dark halo by slowly growing a potential in the center of the particle
distribution. The dark halo transforms from a prolate-triaxial halo ($T \sim
0.8$) to an oblate-triaxial halo ($T \sim 0.5$) while approximately preserving
the flattening ($c/a \sim 0.5$). The main implication is that dark halos are
rounder and more oblate than previous predictions of purely collisionless
simulations with the new constraint that $b/a \gapp 0.7$. At the same time, the
distribution of intrinsic flattenings of dark halos ($\langle c/a \rangle =
0.5$, $\langle (c/a)^2 \rangle ^{1/2} = 0.15$) is preserved during the period
of baryonic infall. The oval distortions of disk galaxies should therefore be
slightly less than original predictions from collisionless dark halos. The
predicted distribution of shapes for dark halos from cosmological N-body
simulations is in better agreement with distribution of ellipticities of
elliptical galaxies if we assume all halos and galaxies become oblate-triaxial
in response to baryonic dissipation. The observed distribution of kinematic
misalignment angles is also consistent with this shape distribution if

be truncated at a minimum redshift $z_{min}$ beyond $\sim 0.1$, and suggest
that a simple follow-on instrument to BATSE, with the same trigger window, no

evolution of dark and baryonic matter and of the frequency- dependent spatially

energy and metal enriched gas is returned to the interstellar medium. Two
extreme cases, the formation of an isolated field galaxy and the merging of two
gas rich proto spirals are considered the latter being used as a model for
galaxy formation in a cluster. The isolated galaxy is assumed to interact with
the surrounding matter via tidal fields only, resulting in a rotation with a
spin parameter of about 0.08. The forming field galaxy shows the main
properties of spiral galaxies: A metal rich, rotatianally flattened bulge, a
metal poor anisotrope stellar halo and a exponetial disk of nearly solar
composition. The spiral is embedded in a triaxial halo of dark matter. The
stars of the bulge form from gas which is initially located in the largest
maxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas the halo stars originate
from gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima. Merging proto spirals evolve to
objects which can be interpreted as luminous ellipticals . The metal rich
anisotrope elliptical rotates only slowly. Depending on the geometry of the
merger event sometimes counter rotating gas is observed.

detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the
average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score

  DO-TH 93-11","Phys.Rev.D48:5280-5285,1993","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.5280",,"hep-ph",,"  We investigate CP-violation effects in the bosonic sector of the Standard
Model (SM) with two Higgs doublets. First we calculate the mass eigenstates of
the physical neutral Higgses for small but nonzero CP-violation parameter
$\xi_{\ast}$, and then a ``forward-backward'' asymmetry ${\cal A}_{fb}$ for the
decay $H \to W^+W^-Z$ that would be a signal of CP-violation. Although the
effects are in general small (${\cal A}_{fb} = \Gamma_{fb}/\Gamma \sim {\cal
O}(10^{-3})$), ${\cal A}_{fb}$ turns out to be a rather clean signal of
CP-violation, since neither the CP-conserving final state interactions nor the
direct production background events contribute to $\Gamma_{fb}$. The process is
a counterexample to the widespread belief that CP-violation processes must
involve fermions. The CKM-type CP-violation effects that could in principle
also contribute to ${\cal A}_{fb}$ are negligible. The nonzero ${\cal A}_{fb}$
could possibly be detected at some later stage in future colliders such as LHC
or SSC.

extend that approach to any SU(l,1) group and construct explicitly

with the projective space $CP^{l}$, which parametrizes CS of the SU(l+1) group,

provide a possibility for an explicit analysis of the quantization problem on

directly generalizable to theories with graded gauge symmetries. For
relativistic particles reasonable results are obtained although there exists no
completely Lorentz covariant quantization of the coordinate and momenta on

whether or not the time coordinate is quantized with positive or indefinite

an evolution is very likely to occur. In essence, it takes place when a
derivative discontinuity is seeded in the dilaton field by an incident tachyon
pulse. An application of this scenario to $1 + 1$ dimensional toy models
suggests that a black hole can evolve into a massive remnant, strengthening its
candidacy for the end state of a black hole.

using integral transforms suggested by the required scattering theory. The
usual class of PI in 3 dimensions (i.e. the self adjoint extensions of the
Laplacian on the domain of smooth functions compactly supported away from the
origin) is reconstructed. In addition a 1-parameter family of GPI models termed
resonance point interactions (RPI) is constructed, labelled by $M$. The case
$M<0$ coincides with a special case of a known GPI model; the case $M>0$
appears to be new. In both cases, the Hilbert space of states must be extended,
for $M<0$, a larger Hilbert space is required, whilst for $M>0$, the Hilbert
space is extended to a Pontryagin space. In the latter case, the space of
physical states is identified as a positive definite invariant subspace.
Complete M{\o}ller wave operators are constructed for the models considered,
using a two space formalism where necessary, which confirm that the PI and RPI
models exhibit the required scattering theory. The physical interpretation of
RPI as models for quantum mechanical systems exhibiting zero energy resonances
is described.
