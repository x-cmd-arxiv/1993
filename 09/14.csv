resolve the long standing problem of the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B isotopic ratio which
amounts to 4 at the time of the formation of the solar system. This hypothesis
may be ultimately constrained by the $B/Be$ ratio observed in halo stars.
Though we are able to obtain a solar isotopic ratio $^{11}B/^{10}B \simeq 4$,
the current paucity of data at low metallicity prevents us from making a
definitive conclusion regarding the resolution of this problem. We show
however, that neutrino process nucleosynthesis leads to a relatively model
independent prediction that the $B/Be$ elemental ratio is large ($>$ 50) at low
metallicities ($[Fe/H] < -3.0$), if $Be$ is produced as a secondary element (as
is the case in the conventional scenario of galactic cosmic-ray
nucleosynthesis).

  Cosmological Velocity Fields ed F Bouchet & M. Lachieze-Rey (revised--typo in
  eq.4, numerical value correct)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Velocity bias is a reduction of the velocity dispersion of tracer galaxies in
comparison to the velocity dispersion of the underlying mass field. There are
two distinct forms of velocity bias. The single particle velocity reduction,
$b_v(1)$, is the result of energy loss of a tracer population, and in
virialized regions, such as galaxy clusters, is intimately associated with mass
segregation which together lead to cluster mass underestimates. The pairwise
velocity bias, $b_v(2)$, has an additional statistical reduction if the total
mass per galaxy rises with velocity dispersion of the virialized cluster.
Values of the velocity bias are estimated from n-body simulations, finding
$b_v(1)\simeq 0.85\pm0.1$ and $b_v(2)\simeq 0.6\pm0.2$. The value of $b_v(1)$
is relatively secure and predicts that the virial radius of the cluster light
is about 20\% of the cluster mass, which can be tested with observations of
cluster mass profiles beyond the apparent virial radius. The value of $b_v(2)$
is sensitive to the formation efficiency of galaxies over environments ranging
from voids to rich clusters, the latter of which are not yet well resolved in
simulations. An $n=1$, $\Omega=1$, COBE normalized CDM spectrum requires
$b_v(2)\simeq0.20(15\mu K/Q)(\sigma_{12}/317 \kms)$ which is well below the
measured range of $b_v(2)$. The pairwise velocities at 1 \hmpc\ allow
$\Omega=1$ for a galaxy clustering bias near unity if $b_v(2)\simeq0.6$.

matter fields to be formulated in terms of a unitarily evolving state vector

surfaces, as in the case of spacetimes with closed timelike curves, a more
general formulation of quantum mechanics is required. In such generalizations
the transition matrix between alternatives in regions of spacetime where states
{\it can} be defined may be non-unitary. This paper describes a generalized
quantum mechanics whose probabilities consistently obey the rules of
probability theory even in the presence of such non-unitarity. The usual notion
of state on a spacelike surface is lost in this generalization and familiar
notions of causality are modified. There is no signaling outside the light
cone, no non-conservation of energy, no ``Everett phones'', and probabilities
of present events do not depend on particular alternatives of the future.
However, the generalization is acausal in the sense that the existence of
non-chronal regions of spacetime in the future can affect the probabilities of
alternatives today. The detectability of non-unitary evolution and violations
of causality in measurement situations are briefly considered. The evolution of
information in non-chronal spacetimes is described.

  U-statistics",,"Annals Prob. 23, (1995), 806-816",,,"math.FA",,"  In this paper the following result, which allows one to decouple U-Statistics
in tail probability, is proved in full generality.
  Theorem 1. Let $X_i$ be a sequence of independent random variables taking
values in a measure space $S$, and let $f_{i_1...i_k}$ be measurable functions
from $S^k$ to a Banach space $B$. Let $(X_i^{(j)})$ be independent copies of
$(X_i)$. The following inequality holds for all $t \ge 0$ and all $n\ge 2$, $$
P(||\sum_{1\le i_1 \ne ... \ne i_k \le n} f_{i_1 ... i_k}(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k})
|| \ge t) \qquad\qquad$$ $$ \qquad\qquad\le C_k P(C_k||\sum_{1\le i_1 \ne ...
\ne i_k \le n} f_{i_1 ... i_k}(X_{i_1}^{(1)},...,X_{i_k}^{(k)}) || \ge t) .$$
Furthermore, the reverse inequality also holds in the case that the functions
$\{f_{i_1... i_k}\}$ satisfy the symmetry condition $$ f_{i_1 ...
i_k}(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k}) = f_{i_{\pi(1)} ...
i_{\pi(k)}}(X_{i_{\pi(1)}},...,X_{i_{\pi(k)}}) $$ for all permutations $\pi$ of
$\{1,...,k\}$. Note that the expression $i_1 \ne ... \ne i_k$ means that $i_r
\ne i_s$ for $r\ne s$. Also, $C_k$ is a constant that depends only on $k$.

description of this process with other areas are shown which include Feynman's
theory of the $\lambda$ transition in liquid Helium, Bose condensation, and
Markov process models used in stochastic networks and polymer physics. These
parallels are used to generalize and further develop a previous exactly
solvable model of nuclear fragmentation. An analysis of some experimental data
is given.

origin. We prove there is a solution with each prescribed number of nodes.
