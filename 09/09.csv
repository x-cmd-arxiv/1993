that degenerate through secondary cavitation of the foam walls. This robust
morphological mechanism results from a virtual competition for space between
the cavities. In cosmology, Voronoi foams are known to explain important
features of the large scale structure, but the physical mechanism for the
formation of such foams is unknown. We here present a scenario for the
formation of large scale structure: Cavitation initiates at the abrupt
reduction of radiation pressure on matter at decoupling and results in the cold
flow of matter into a single, void-dominated structure with a scale determined
by the Hubble sphere at decoupling. This mechanism does not impose restrictions
on the smoothness of the last scattering surface at decoupling and conserves
the entropy of matter during the self-organization of a single cavitation foam
spanning the observable universe.

for flux. The model is motivated by gauge theory and is equivalent to the Ising
model in three dimensions. The phase with condensed flux is studied. This is
the ordered phase of the Ising model and the high temperature, deconfined phase
of the gauge theory. The flux picture will be used in this phase. Near the
transition, the density is low enough so that flux variables remain useful.
There is a finite density of finite flux clusters on both sides of the phase
transition. In the deconfined phase, there is also an infinite, percolating
network of flux with a density that vanishes as $T \rightarrow T_{c}^{+}$. On
both sides of the critical point, the nonanalyticity in the total flux density
is characterized by the exponent $(1-\alpha)$. The main result of this paper is
a calculation of the critical exponent for the percolating network. The
exponent for the density of the percolating cluster is $ \zeta = (1-\alpha) -
(\varphi-1)$. The specific heat exponent $\alpha$ and the crossover exponent
$\varphi$ can be computed in the $\epsilon$-expansion. Since $\zeta <
(1-\alpha)$, the variation in the separate densities is much more rapid than
that of the total. Flux is moving from the infinite cluster to the finite
clusters much more rapidly than the total density is decreasing.

The gauge field Bianchi and Ricci identities yield a set of partial

spatial geometry thus underlies the gauge-invariant configuration space of the

transformations. Spatial derivative terms in the energy density are singular
when $\det G=\det B=0$. These singularities are the analogue of the centrifugal
barrier of quantum mechanics, and physical wave-functionals are forced to
vanish in a certain manner near $\det B=0$. It is argued that such barriers are
an inevitable result of the projection on the gauge-invariant subspace of the
Hilbert space, and that the barriers are a conspicuous way in which non-abelian

expectation value (VEV) of a charged order parameter is zero at any non-zero
temperature, the model nevertheless exhibits a rich phase structure in the

parameter and due to the non-trivial dynamics of the vortex excitations on the
plane. These are: a confined-vortex phase which is superconducting at low
temperatures, an intermediate-temperature phase with deconfined vortices, and a
high-temperature phase, where the neutral order parameter vanishes. The
manifestation of superconductivity at low-temperatures and its disappearance
above a critical temperature is explicitly shown to be due to the vortex
confinement/deconfinement mechanism of Kosterlitz and Thouless. The ground
state does not break parity or time-reversal symmetries and the ratio of the
