measurements of spiral galaxies, and that derived independently from Dn-sigma
measurements of ellipticals and S0s, are noisy versions of the same underlying
velocity field. The radial velocity fields are derived using tensor Gaussian
smoothing of radius 1200 km/s. They are compared at grid points near which the
sampling by both types of galaxies is proper. This requirement defines a volume
of ~(50 Mpc/h)^3, containing ~10 independent subvolumes, mostly limited by the
available ellipticals. The two fields are compared using a correlation
statistic, whose distribution is determined via Monte-Carlo simulations. We
find that the data is consistent with the hypothesis, at the 10% level. We
demonstrate that the failure to reject the correlation is not just a result of
the errors being big, by using the same method to rule out complete
independence between the fields at the 99.8% level. The zero points of the two
distance indicators are matched by maximizing the correlation between the two
velocity fields. There is a marginal hint that the ellipticals tend to stream
slower than the spirals by ~8%. The correlation reinforced here is consistent
with the common working hypotheses that (a) the derived large-scale velocity
field is real, (b) it has a gravitational origin, and (c) the large-scale
velocities of spirals and ellipticals are hardly biased relative to each other.
On the other hand, it does not rule out any alternative to gravity where
objects of all types obtain similar large-scale velocities.

  Velocity Fields"" ed. F Bouchet & M. Lachieze-Rey, CSR-AT-93-22",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear mode
coupling of density fluctuations. We find that for realistic cosmological
spectra there is a significant contribution to the nonlinear evolution on
scales of interest to large-scale structure from the long-wave part of the
initial spectrum. A consequence of this mode coupling is that at high redshift,
$z$, the nonlinear scale [defined by $\sigma(z)=1$] can be significantly larger
than a linear extrapolation would indicate. For the standard CDM spectrum with
a $\sigma_8=1$ normalization the mass corresponding to the nonlinear scale at
$z=20, 10, 5$ is about $100, 10, 3$ times (respectively) larger than the
linearly extrapolated value. We also investigate the possibility of divergent
contributions to the density field from long-wave modes if the spectral index
of the power spectrum $\ n<-1$. Using an approximate non-perturbative approach
we find that for $n>-3\,$ the divergent contribution appears only in the phase.
This can be related to the large-scale bulk velocity, and clarifies previous
results from N-body simulations.

The current and density of states are obtained via the non-crossing
approximation for two spin-degenerate levels weakly coupled to two leads. At
low temperatures, the Kondo peak in the equilibrium density of states strongly
enhances the linear-response conductance. Application of a finite voltage bias
reduces the conductance and splits the peak in the density of states. The split
peaks, one at each chemical potential, are suppressed in amplitude by a finite
dissipative lifetime. We estimate this lifetime perturbatively as the time to
transfer an electron from the higher chemical potential lead to the lower
chemical potential one. At zero magnetic field, the clearest signatures of the
Kondo effect in transport through a quantum dot are the broadening, shift, and
enhancement of the linear-response conductance peaks at low temperatures, and a
peak in the nonlinear differential conductance around zero bias.

This model contains two massive spin-2 excitations. However, since its

have any physical relevance.In other words, topological massive gravity cannot
be spontaneously broken down by the presence of the triadic CS term.

relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock equation for finite nuclei are discussed
using realistic One-Boson-Exchange potentials. In a first scheme, the effects
of correlations are deduced from a study of nuclear matter and parameterized in
terms of an effective $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\pi$ exchange. Employing this
effective interaction relativistic Hartree-Fock equations are solved for finite
nuclei \osi , \caf\ and \cafe . In the second approach the effect of
correlations are treated in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation directly
for the finite nuclei, but the modifications of the Dirac spinors in the medium
are derived from nuclear matter assuming a local-density approximation. Both
approaches yield rather similar results for binding energies and radii in fair
agreement with experimental data. The importance of the density dependent
correlation effects is demonstrated and different ingredients to the spin-orbit
splitting in the shell-model of the nucleus are discussed.
