spectrography (TIGER, 0"".9 FWHM) of the central nucleus of M31 have been
obtained at CFHT. The photometric data clearly show the double-peaked nucleus,
in excellent agreement with a recent HST image by Lauer et al. 1993. We built
deconvolved surface brightness models, using the multi-Gaussian expansion
method. We then perform a detailed morphological analysis of the three central
photometric components (bulge, nucleus and bright secondary peak) and derive
various spatial luminosity models (oblate and triaxial). Stellar velocity and
velocity dispersion fields were derived from the TIGER data: the former
displays an extremely rapid rotation around the true center of the galaxy,
while the latter exhibits a peaked structure offset in the opposite direction
of the brightest light peak. Neglecting these offsets,both extended versions of
the virial theorem and detailed hydrodynamical models confirm the classical
strong central mass concentration, perhaps a supermassive black hole of about
7.10**7 Msun, as well as a large excess of circular motions. These offsets,
however, suggest that the nucleus presently undergoes a strong stellar
oscillation, with non-stationary, non-axisymmetric dynamics. This too reopens
the case for a strong central mass concentration.

flow under a time-dependent perturbation with period T where the global
diffusion occurs along the stochastic web. By using the Melnikov method we
construct the separatrix map describing the approximate dynamics near the
saddle separatrices. Focusing on the small T, the width of the stochastic layer
is calculated analytically by using the residue criterion and the diffusion
constant by using the random phase assumption and correlated random walks. The
analytical results are in good agreements with the results of two different
types of numerical simulations by integrations of the Hamilton's equation of
motion and by iterations of the separatrix map, which establishes the validity
of the use of the separatrix map.

was proven for quasi-hyperbolic points by Douady and Hubbard, and for
boundaries of hyperbolic components by Yoccoz. More recently Yoccoz proved MLC
for all at most finitely renormalizable parameter values. One of our goals is
to prove MLC for some infinitely renormalizable parameter values. Loosely
speaking, we need all renormalizations to have bounded combinatorial rotation
number (assumption C1) and sufficiently high combinatorial type (assumption
C2).
  For real quadratic polynomials of bounded combinatorial type the complex a
priori bounds were obtained by Sullivan. Our result complements the Sullivan's
result in the unbounded case. Moreover, it gives a background for Sullivan's
renormalization theory for some bounded type polynomials outside the real line
where the problem of a priori bounds was not handled before for any single
polynomial.
  An important consequence of a priori bounds is absence of invariant
measurable line fields on the Julia set (McMullen) which is equivalent to
quasi-conformal (qc) rigidity. To prove stronger topological rigidity we
construct a qc conjugacy between any two topologically conjugate polynomials
(Theorem III). We do this by means of a pull-back argument, based on the linear
growth of moduli and a priori bounds. Actually the argument gives the stronger
combinatorial rigidity which implies MLC.
