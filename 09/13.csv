  Acta Astronomica (Proc. Workshop on Planetary Nebula Nuclei, Bachotek,
  September 1993) ESO-AAZ-1",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a radiative-transfer calculation which reproduces the infrared
spectrum of the planetary nebula BD+30$^{\circ}$3639, fitting both the spectral
energy distribution and the spatial extent at infrared wavelengths. We obtain
an acceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the infrared bands. The
fit requires a distance of $\ge 2 \kpc$, which implies that BD+30$^\circ$3639
has evolved from a massive progenitor of several solar masses. Two surprising
results are (1) a very low dust-to-gas ratio, (2) an absence of the smallest
PAH molecules. Extrapolating back in time, we calculate the previous infrared
evolution of BD+30$^\circ$3639.

  HU-TFT-93-45",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  We explore constraints on various forms for the effective potential during
inflation based upon a statistical comparison between inflation-generated
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background temperature and the COBE DMR
results. Fits to the COBE 53A+B x 90A+B angular correlation function are
obtained using simple analytic forms for the effective potential in chaotic
inflation models. Not surprisingly, these fits are optimized for a nearly
scale-free fluctuation power spectrum. However, from the chi^2 distribution for
the fits we can set upper limits of n le 1.2 and n le 7 at the 1 sigma and 2
sigma confidence levels, respectively, for a V(phi) = lambda phi^n effective
potential. Similarly, new limits on parameters for polynomial effective
potentials can be determined at the 1 sigma and 2 sigma confidence levels. The
most stringent constraint, however, is on the overall magnitude of the
effective potential.

can be satisfactorily reproduced by assuming approximate wave functions. These
wave functions are shown to correspond to moving hidden domain walls, i.e. to
one-soliton excitations.

solution to deal with this problem exactly. We find that the interplay of
spin-orbit interaction and electron-electron interaction plays a crucial role,
bringing about some new effects on the orbital magnetism.

edge excitations on the $\nu=1/m$ Laughlin states.

coupling is shown to evolve according to perturbation theory. In that regime
the coupling in the MS-bar scheme of dimensional regularization is obtained
with an estimated total error of a few percent.
