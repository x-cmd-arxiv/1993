radius to a maximum value and recontracts, can be regarded as one possible mode

Wheeler. The dynamics of a particularly simple version of such a wormhole can
be reduced to that of a single quantity, its throat radius; this wormhole thus
provides a ``minisuperspace model'' for a structure in Lorentzian-signature
foam. The classical equation of motion for the wormhole throat is obtained from
the Einstein field equations and a suitable equation of state for the matter at
the throat. Analysis of the quantum behavior of the hole then proceeds from an
action corresponding to that equation of motion. The action obtained simply by
calculating the scalar curvature of the hole spacetime yields a model with
features like those of the relativistic free particle. In particular the
Hamiltonian is nonlocal, and for the wormhole cannot even be given as a
differential operator in closed form. Nonetheless the general solution of the
Schr\""odinger equation for wormhole wave functions, i.e., the wave-function
propagator, can be expressed as a path integral. Too complicated to perform
exactly, this can yet be evaluated via a WKB approximation. The result
indicates that the wormhole, classically stable, is quantum-mechanically
unstable: A Feynman-Kac decomposition of the WKB propagator yields no spectrum
of bound states. Though an initially localized wormhole wave function may
oscillate for many classical expansion/recontraction periods, it must
