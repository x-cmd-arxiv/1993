  /ftp/cita/nick/iap.ps",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  I review a number of tests of theories for structure formation. Large-scale
flows and IRAS galaxies indicate a high density parameter $\Omega \simeq 1$, in
accord with inflationary predictions, but it is not clear how this meshes with
the uniformly low values obtained from virial analysis on scales $\sim$ 1Mpc.
Gravitational distortion of faint galaxies behind clusters allows one to
construct maps of the mass surface density, and this should shed some light on
the large vs small-scale $\Omega$ discrepancy. Power spectrum analysis reveals
too red a spectrum (compared to standard CDM) on scales $\lambda \sim 10-100$
$h^{-1}$Mpc, but the gaussian fluctuation hypothesis appears to be in good
shape. These results suggest that the problem for CDM lies not in the very
early universe --- the inflationary predictions of $\Omega = 1$ and gaussianity
both seem to be OK; furthermore, the COBE result severely restricts
modifications such as tilting the primordial spectrum --- but in the assumed
matter content. The power spectrum problem can be solved by invoking a cocktail
of mixed dark matter. However, if gravitational lensing fails to reveal
extended dark mass around clusters then we may be forced to explore more
radical possibilities for the dark matter.

in relativistic CS matter theory, and moreover show equivalence of several
models. We study CS vector model in some details, which provide consistent
check to the assertion of the equivalence.

for $SU3 \supset SU2 \otimes U1$ is made, in the spirit of traditional
treatments of SU2 coupling. The coefficients are defined as the overlap matrix
element between product states and a coupled state with good SU3 quantum
numbers. A technique for resolution of the outer degeneracy problem, based upon
actions of the infinitesimal generators of SU3 is developed, which
automatically produces vector coupling coefficients with symmetries under
exchange of state labels which parallel the familiar symmetries of the SU2
case. An algorithm for efficient computation of these coefficients is outlined,
for which an ANSI C code is available.
