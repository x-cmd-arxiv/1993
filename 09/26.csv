"hep-ph/9309325",,"Yosef Nir","New Physics Effects on CP Violation in $B$ Decays","22 pages, WIS-93/94/Aug-PH",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We review new physics effects on CP violation in B decays. We describe the
Standard Model predictions for the various types of CP asymmetries and discuss
the theoretical cleanliness of these predictions. We point out the ingredients
in the analysis that are most sensitive to new physics and deduce the type of
new physics that is likely to modify the Standard Model predictions. Several
explicit examples are discussed in detail. Finally, we explain how, if
deviations from the Standard Model predictions are measured, we will be able to
learn detailed features of the new physics involved. Plenary talk presented at
the Workshop on B Physics at Hadron Accelerators, Snowmass, Colorado, June 21 -
July 2, 1993.
