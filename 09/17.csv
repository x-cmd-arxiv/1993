based on seed-like primordial perturbations (like cosmic strings or textures),
from models based on Gaussian fluctuations. We investigate analytically the
{\it Fourier space} statistical properties of temperature or density
fluctuation patterns generated by seed-like objects and compare these
properties with those of Gaussian fluctuations generated during inflation.
  We show that the proposed statistical test can easily identify temperature
fluctuations produced by a superposition of a small number of seeds per horizon
scale for {\it any} observational angular resolution and {\it any} seed
geometry. However, due to the Central Limit Theorem, the distinction becomes
more difficult as the number of seeds in the fluctuation pattern increases.

  preprint numbers IASSNS-AST 93/57 and MIT-CSR-93-21",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper reviews the essential physics of gravitational instability in a
Robertson-Walker background spacetime. Three approaches are presented in a
pedagogical manner, based on (1) the Eulerian fluid equations, (2) the
Lagrangian description of trajectories, and (3) the Lagrangian fluid equations.
Linear and nonlinear limits are discussed for each case. Shear and tides are
shown to play a key role in nonlinear gravitational instability.
  The Lagrangian fluid approach is used to show that several widely held
beliefs about gravitational instability are false. The following collapse
theorem is proven: for a given initial density fluctuation and growth rate, the
spherical tophat perturbation collapses more slowly than any other
configuration. We also show that density maxima are not the first points to
collapse and that underdense regions may collapse if their initial shear is
sufficiently high. The Lagrangian fluid approach leads to an almost closed set
of local evolution equations for individual mass elements. The magnetic part of
the Weyl tensor, which may be present even in the nonrelativistic (Newtonian)
limit, may prevent a purely local description. However, neglecting the magnetic
part of the Weyl tensor, we obtain predictions for high-redshift collapse that
are in good agreement with a high-resolution cold dark matter N-body
simulation.

degrees of freedom in two dimensional strongly correlated systems. We establish
a set of sufficient conditions for the occurence of spin and charge separation.
Specifically, we discuss this issue in the context of the Heisenberg model for
spin-1/2 on a square lattice with nearest ($J_1$) and next-nearest ($J_2$)
neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. Our formulation makes explicit the
existence of a local SU(2) gauge symmetry once the spin-1/2 operators are
replaced by bound states of spinons. The mean-field theory for the spinons is
solved numerically as a function of the ratio $J_2/J_1$ for the so-called s-RVB
Ansatz. A second order phase transition exists into a novel flux state for
$J_2/J_1>(J_2/J_1)_{{\rm cr}}$. We identify the range $0<J_2/J_1<(J_2/J_1)_{\rm
cr}$ as the s-RVB phase. It is characterized by the existence of a finite gap
to the elementary excitations (spinons) and the breakdown of all the continuous
gauge symmetries. An effective continuum theory for the spinons and the gauge
degrees of freedom is constructed just below the onset of the flux phase. We
argue that this effective theory is consistent with the deconfinement of the
spinons carrying the fundamental charge of the gauge group. We contrast this
result with the study of the one dimensional quantum antiferromagnet within the
same approach. We show that in the one dimensional model, the spinons of the
gauge picture are always confined and thus cannot be identified with the
gapless spin-1/2 excitations of the quantum antiferromagnet Heisenberg model.

hope, produce agreement with experiment. This is to be done by using covariant
perturbation theory, in which these inconsistencies are not present. The
covariant perturbation theory is developed starting from a model Lagrangian, in
order to fix notation and phases. It is shown that both old-fashioned
