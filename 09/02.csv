of the coupling constants. If the masses of these DIPS are greater than the
scale $V_s$ characterizing the spontaneous violation of the global lepton
symmetry they are absent at the corresponding phase transition ($T \sim V_s$)

thermal equilibrium during the history of the universe. In the alternative case

possible signature is an X-ray line at $E_\gamma = \frac{m_J}{2}$, produced by
the decay $J \to \gamma + \gamma$. A model is described which realizes the
