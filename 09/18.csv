"astro-ph/9309026",,"Michael A. Nowak","A Cautionary Note on Gamma Ray Burst Nearest Neighbor Statistics","7, plain tex, CITA-93-",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this letter we explore the suggestion of Quashnock and Lamb (1993) that
nearest neighbor correlations among gamma ray burst positions indicate the
possibility of burst repetitions within various burst sub-classes. With the aid
of Monte Carlo calculations we compare the observed nearest neighbor
distributions with those expected from an isotropic source population weighted
by the published BATSE exposure map. The significance of the results are
assessed via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, as well as by a comparison to
Monte Carlo simulations. The K-S results are in basic agreement with those of
Quashnock and Lamb. However, as Narayan and Piran (1993) point out, and the
Monte Carlo calculations confirm, the K-S test overestimates the significance
of the observed distributions. We compare the sensitivity of these results to
both the definitions of the assumed burst sub-classes and the burst positional
errors. Of the two, the positional errors are more significant and indicate
that the results of Quashnock and Lamb may be due to systematic errors, rather
than any intrinsic correlation among the burst positions. Monte Carlo
simulations also show that with the current systematic errors, the nearest
neighbor statistic is not very sensitive to moderate repetition rates. Until
the BATSE statistical and systematic errors are fully understood, the burst
nearest neighbor correlations cannot be claimed to be significant evidence for
burst repetitions. (Figures available as postscript files from the author.)

decomposition into adjacent domains some of which correspond to the
(complexified) Kahler cones of topologically distinct manifolds. These domains
are separated by walls corresponding to singular Calabi-Yau spaces in which the
spacetime metric has degenerated in certain regions. We show that the union of
these domains is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of a single
topological Calabi-Yau space---the mirror. In this way we resolve a puzzle for
mirror symmetry raised by the apparent asymmetry between the Kahler and complex
structure moduli spaces of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Furthermore, using mirror
symmetry, we show that we can interpolate in a physically smooth manner between
any two theories represented by distinct points in the Kahler moduli space,
even if such points correspond to topologically distinct spaces. Spacetime
topology change in string theory, therefore, is realized by the most basic
operation of deformation by a truly marginal operator. Finally, this work also
