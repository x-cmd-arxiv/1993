inputs, the boolean function, and the initial state of each gate are chosen
randomly. In this article, each gate has two inputs. Let $a$ (respectively $c$)
be the probability the the gate is assigned a constant function (respectively a
non-canalyzing function, i.e., {\sc equivalence} or {\sc exclusive or}).
Previous work has shown that when $a > c$, with probability asymptotic to 1,
the random automaton exhibits very stable behavior: almost all of the gates
stabilize, almost all of them are weak, i.e., they can be perturbed without
affecting the state cycle that is entered, and the state cycle is bounded in
size. This article gives evidence that the condition $a = c$ is a threshold of
chaotic behavior: with probability asymptotic to 1, almost all of the gates are
still stable and weak, but the state cycle size is unbounded. In fact, the
average state cycle size is superpolynomial in the number of gates.

  bounds","Phys.Rev.D49:333-342,1994","10.1103/PhysRevD.49.333",,"hep-ph",,"  We make a comprehensive study of indirect bounds on scalar leptoquarks that
couple chirally and diagonally to the first generation by examining available
data from low energy experiments as well as from high energy e+ e- and p pbar
accelerators. The strongest bounds turn out to arise from low energy data: For
leptoquarks that couple to right--handed quarks, the most stringent bound comes
from atomic parity violation. For leptoquarks that couple to left--handed
quarks, there are two mass regions: At low masses the bounds arise from atomic
parity violation or from universality in leptonic pi decays. At masses above a
few hundred GeV's, the dominant bounds come from the FCNC processes that are
unavoidable in these leptoquarks: The FCNC bound of the up sector, that arises
from D-Dbar mixing, combines with the FCNC bounds from the down sector, that
arise from rare K decays and K-Kbar mixing, to a bound on the flavour
CONSERVING coupling to the first generation.
  The bounds restrict leptoquarks that couple with electromagnetic strength to
lie above 600 GeV or 630 GeV for leptoquarks that couple to RH quarks, and
above 1040 GeV, 440 GeV, and 750 GeV for the SU(2)_W scalar, doublet and
triplet leptoquarks that couple to LH quarks. These bounds are considerably
stronger than the first results from the direct searches at HERA. Our bounds
also already exclude large regions in the parameter space that could be
examined by various methods proposed for indirect leptoquark searches.

self-energy $\Sigma_{\Delta}$ from the two-body absorption process
$\Delta+N\rightarrow 2N$. This contribution is calculated using a recently
developed non-relativistic scheme, which allows for an evaluation of the
self-energy with a basis of single-particle states appropriate for both bound
hole states and for particle states in the continuum. In order to test the
medium dependence of the self-energy, we calculate the two-body absorption term
$\Sigma_{\Delta}^{A2}$ for several finite nuclei with $N=Z$, i.e.\ $^{16}$O,
$^{40}$Ca and $^{100}$Sn. The resulting self-energy, which is energy dependent
and non-local, is compared with a simple parameterization derived from nuclear
matter.
