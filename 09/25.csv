  ICRR-Report-301-93-13",,"10.1093/mnras/269.3.563",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate reheating of the universe by early formation of stars and
quasars in the hierarchical clustering scheme of cold dark matter scenario,
with perturbation fluctuations normalized by the COBE data. It is found that
ionizing uv flux from OB stars with the abundance given by the standard initial
mass function is strong enough to ionize the universe from $z\approx 30$ to the
present epoch, if 1--2\% of the collapsed baryons go into stars. This lessens
significantly the CMB anisotropies at a small angular scale. Reionization also
increases the Jeans mass to $M_{\rm luminous}\approx 10^9M_\odot$ for $z\lsim
10$, which leads to a cut-off of the luminosity function of normal galaxies on
a faint side. A strong uv flux is expected at $z\approx 2-5$, and the null
result of the Gunn-Peterson test is naturally explained. Early star formation
also results in production of heavy elements, and the observational metal
abundance sets a strong constraint on the photon energy injection into the
intergalactic space.

effective interacting vortex gas by a systematic perturbative elimination of
all fluctuating degrees of freedom (amplitude {\em and} phase of the order
parameter field) except the vortex positions. In the Coulomb gas descriptions
derived previously in the literature, thermal amplitude fluctuations were
neglected altogether. We argue that, if one includes the latter, the vortices
still form a two- dimensional Coulomb gas, but the vortex fugacity can be
substantially raised. Under the assumption that Minnhagen's generic phase
diagram of the two- dimensional Coulomb gas is correct, our results then point
to a first order transition rather than a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition,
provided the Ginzburg-Landau correlation length is large enough in units of a
microscopic cutoff length for fluctuations. The experimental relevance of these
results is briefly discussed. [Submitted to J. Stat. Phys.]

the light-cone due to the scatter of gravitational waves off the background
curvature.

best described by a classical pion field. Such a field might be an isospin
rotated vacuum of the chiral $\sigma$-model or, as discussed in this work, a
solution of the equations of motion resultinng from the coupling of fields of
this model to quarks produced in the collision. In such configurations all
directions in isospin space are allowed leading to a sizable probability of
events with, essentially, only charged particles (Centauros) or all neutral
particles (anti-Centauros). (In more common statistical models of multiparticle
production, the probability of such events is suppressed exponentially by the
total multiplicity.) We find that the isospin violation due to the mass
difference of the up and down quarks has a significant effect on these
distributions and enhances the production of events consisting predominantly of
neutral particles.
