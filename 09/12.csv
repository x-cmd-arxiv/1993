  Supercollider, Argonne National Laboratory, June 2-5, 1993.)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We show that photoproduction cross sections recently measured by ZEUS and H-1
at HERA energies$^1$ are in agreement with our earlier prediction based on
high-energy hadronic structure of the photon in the QCD minijet-type model$^2$.
We present results of an improved calculation of the photoproduction cross
section, in which the soft part, motivated by the Regge theory, is taken to be
energy-dependent and the semi-hard hadronic part is carefully eikonalized to
take into account for the multiple scatterings and to include the appropriate
probability that photon would act hadronicaly$^3$. We also show that the
extrapolation of our cross section to ultra-high energies, of relevance to the
cosmic ray physics, gives significant contribution to the ``conventional''
value, but cannot account for the anomalous muon content observed in the cosmic
ray air-showers associated with astrophysical point sources$^4$.

  Regensburg preprint TPR--93--25",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We review in brief the development and implementation of the Star integral, a
tool yielding measurements of correlations much superior to conventional
methods. A version for use in pion interferometry is explained. We also show
how effects of non-poissonian overall multiplicity distributions may be
eliminated if desired and quote results eliminating statistical biases arising
in correlation measurements within small samples.

lattice is studied with the inclusion of vortices in the action. Using a random
matrix formulation, in the continuum limit for genus zero surfaces the
partition function is found exactly, as a function of the chemical potential
for vortices of unit winding number, at a specific radius in the plasma phase.
This solution is used to describe the Kosterlitz- Thouless phenomenon in the
presence of 2D quantum gravity as one passes from the ultra-violet to the
infra-red.
