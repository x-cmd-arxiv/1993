  $\Omega$ and the Power Spectrum","Paris Conference--9 pages--uuencoded postscript file, IOA9-20",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the nature of galaxy clustering in redshift space using a method
based on an expansion of the galaxian density field in Spherical Harmonics and
linear theory. We derive a compact and self-consistent expression for the
distortion when applied to flux limited redshift surveys. The amplitude of the
distortion is controlled by the combination of the density and bias parameters,
$\beta\equiv\Omega_\circ^{0.6}/b$ as well as the shape of the real space power
spectrum, $P(k)$ (characterized by a shape parameter $\Gamma$), and its
normalization, $\sigma_8$; we exploit this fact to derive a maximum likelihood
estimator for $\beta$, $\Gamma$, and $\sigma_8$. We check our formalism using
$N$-body simulations and demonstrate it provides an unbiased estimate of
$\beta$ when the amplitude and shape of the galaxy power spectrum is known.
Application of the technique to the 1.2 Jy \iras\ redshift survey yields $\beta
=0.94\pm 0.17$ and $\Gamma=0.17\pm0.05$ (1-$\sigma$) when $\sigma_8$ is held
fixed at its best value as determined from the real space correlation function.
Allowing $\sigma_8$ to be a free parameter, we find $\beta=0.47\pm 0.25$,
$\Gamma=0.15\pm0.05$, and $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.06$.

  WIS-93/89/Sept-PH. (Contributed talk at the 5th International Symposium on
  Heavy Flavour Physics, McGill University, July 6-10, 1993.)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We show that FCNC processes are unavoidable for leptoquarks that couple to
left handed quarks, and derive new FCNC bounds from neutral meson mixing.
Despite being induced only at one loop, these processes lead to significant
bounds since the leptoquark contributions do not suffer from GIM cancellations.
Studying the implications of these bounds we find that (i) The D-Dbar mixing
bound is the first significant FCNC bound from the up sector. Combining it with
FCNC bounds from the down sector we arrive at a bound on the first generation
couplings. (ii) The K-Kbar and D-Dbar mixings bound g^2/M while all other
processes bound g/M. The combined neutral meson mixing bound is therefore
dominant for the heavier leptoquarks, and leads to exclusion of large regions
in parameter space which were previously allowed.

the multiplicity of particles per unit rapidity per unit area, and for
non-abelian gauge theories, some extra media dependent vertices. We explicitly

chiral symmetry for the light degrees of freedom and the heavy quark
spin-flavor symmetries for the heavy quarks. Using these symmetries, together
with the hypothesis of polar q$^2$ dependence of the semileptonic form factors,
one is able to relate $B \to K^* \gamma$ and $D \to K^* \ell \nu$ decays with
the result $ R \, =\, \Gamma(B \to K^* \gamma) / \Gamma(b \to s \gamma) = 0.09

gives the result $ R \, = \, 0.17 \pm 0.05$. Both results are in reasonable
agreement with recent data from the CLEO II Collaboration.

unification, the expected bottom quark - tau lepton Yukawa coupling unification
is very sensitive to the fixed point structure of the top quark mass. For the
presently allowed values of the electroweak parameters and the bottom quark
mass, the Yukawa coupling unification implies that the top quark mass must be
within ten percent of its fixed point values.
