observed distribution of galaxies in redshift space. The method is based on a
kinematic Zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields in
redshift space. This relation is expressed in a differential equation slightly
modified from the usual Poisson equation, and which depends non-trivially on
$\beta \equiv \Omega^{0.6}/b$. The linear equation can be readily solved by
standard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics.
One can also include a term describing the ``rocket effect"" discussed by Kaiser
(1987). From this redshift space information alone, one can generate a
prediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic ($l,m$) as a
function of distance. We note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments,
the equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both the
interior and exterior mass distribution. However, for a shell at distance $r$,
the dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the Local Group
frame is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. This implies that
the shear of the measured velocity field, when fit to a dipole distortion,
should be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the well
determined local galaxy distribution. As a preliminary application we compute
the velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2Jy IRAS survey
compared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recent
POTENT analysis. The coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a best
estimate of $\beta= 0.6 \pm 0.2$.

well-separated pulses. A measure of closeness to homoclinic conditions provides
a small parameter for the development of an asymptotic solution consisting of
superposed, isolated pulses. The solvability condition in the resulting

superstring theories. In particular, in the framework of E$_6$ models the
presence of such symmetries is required in order to allow for the radiative
generation of naturally small neutrino masses. Recently it was shown that by
imposing suitable generation dependent discrete symmetries, a class of models
can be consistently constructed in which the three sets of known fermions in
each generation do not have the same assignments with respect to the {\bf 27}
representation of E$_6$. In this scenario, the different embedding in the gauge
group of the three generations implies in particular that the known charged
leptons couple in a non--universal way to the new neutral gauge bosons
$(Z_\beta)$ present in these models. We exploit this fact to study the
signature of this class of models at present and future $e^+e^-$ colliders. We
show that some signals of deviation from lepton universality as well as some
other discrepancies with the standard model predictions which have been
observed at the TRISTAN collider in the production rate of $\mu$ and $\tau$,
can be accounted for if the $Z_\beta$ mass is not much heavier than 300 GeV. We
also study the discovery limits for lepton universality violation of this type
at LEP-2 and at the 500 GeV $e^+e^-$ Next Linear Collider (NLC). We show that
models predicting unconventional assignments for the leptons will give an
unmistakable signature, when the $Z_\beta$ mass is as heavy as $\sim 800$ GeV
