Keplerian accretion disks. Proposed mechanisms include hydrodynamic and MHD
local instabilities and long range effects mediated by wave transport. The most
promising models incorporate the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, caused by
an instability of the magnetic field embedded in a differentially rotating
disk. This has the important feature that the induced turbulent motions
necessarily transport angular momentum outward. By contrast, convective modes
may transport angular momentum in either direction. Combining the magnetic
field instability with an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo driven by internal waves leads
to a model in which the dimensionless viscosity scales as $(H/r)^{4/3}$.
However, this model has a phenomenology which is quite different from the
$\alpha$ disk model. For example, an active disk implies some source of
excitation for the internal waves. In binary systems with a mass ratio of order
unity the most likely exciting mechanism is a parametric instability due to
tidal forces. This implies that in systems where the accretion stream is
intermittent, like MV Lyrae or TT Ari, epochs when the mass flow is absent or
very small will be epochs in which the disk shrinks and becomes relatively
inactive and dark. This model also implies that forced vertical mixing is
important, even in convectively stable disks. I discuss various observational
tests of this model and the focus of current theoretical work.

  Tokyo 1993",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this talk we discuss three different issues. First of all, there exist
several proposals how to solve cosmological problems by adiabatic expansion of
the Universe, without any use of inflation. We explain why these models do not
solve the flatness/entropy problem. On the other hand there exist some claims
that inflation also does not solve the flatness problem. We show that these
claims are correct to a certain extent for old and new inflation, but are
incorrect for simplest versions of chaotic inflation. The second issue to be
considered is the classification of inflationary models. At present many
inflationary models are compared to each other in order to understand which of
them better describes observational data. Unfortunately, this often leads to
terminological misunderstandings and even to misleading conclusions. We discuss
three coexisting types of classification of inflationary models and explain
their relation to each other. We also briefly describe the hybrid inflation
model, which combines several interesting features of different inflationary
models. Finally we show that it is possible to describe inflationary universe
by a stationary (i.e. time-independent) probability distribution to find a
domain of a given size containing matter with given properties. This represents
a strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang
paradigm.

of King's core-fitting formula for determining mass-to-light ratio. We also
generalize the models to a two-parameter family, in which the galaxy contains a
central black hole; the second parameter is the mass of the black hole. Our
models can be used to estimate the detectability of central black holes and the
velocity-dispersion profiles of galaxies that contain central cusps, with or

during a gas-dynamical interaction with the halo and disk of a spiral galaxy.
By ram pressure, the gas clouds are stripped from the companion, and accreted
to ward the disk of the spiral galaxy. If the companion's orbit is retrograde
with respect to the rotation of the spiral galaxy, infalling clouds hit the
nuclear region. Angular momentum transfer causes disruption of the inner
gaseous disk, and makes a void of interstellar gas in the bulge. If the
companion's orbit is either prograde or polar, infalling clouds are accreted by
the outer disk, and form a rotating gas ring. We show that the ram-pressure
stripping-and-accretion is one way from the companion to a gas-rich larger
galaxy, which causes disposal of interstellar gas from the companion and
effectively changes its galaxy type into earlier (redder). The ram-pressure
process is significant durig merger of galaxies, in which interstellar gas is
stripped and accreted prior to the stellar-body merger. Based on the
simulation, we discuss a possible history of interstellar gas in M31 system,
which comprises M32, NGC 205 and possible merged galaxies. The ram-pressure
stripping explains the disposal of mass lost from evolving stars in the dwarf
elliptical companion M32.

detected from the dark clouds using the Nobeyama 45m telescope, and the virial
mass of individual clouds was estimated to be about 10E6 solar masses. The CO
intensity-to-virial mass ratio is anomalously small, and so is the color
excess-to-mass ratio, which indicates a low temperature and a small amount dust
per unit gas mass in the cloud, respectively. This implies that the molecular
clouds in the central few hundred pc of M31 are more primeval, suggesting a low
star-formation and low dust supply. We propose a possible scenario for the
origin of the face-on spiral containing such gas on the basis of a ram-pressure

produce upwardly-moving muons. We compute these muon fluxes in the context of
the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model, and the no-scale and dilaton
$SU(5)\times U(1)$ supergravity models. At present, with the Kamiokande 90\%
C.L. upper limits on the flux, only a small fraction of the parameter space of
the $SU(5)\times U(1)$ models is accessible for $m_\chi\sim m_{\rm Fe}$, which
in turn implies constraints for the lightest chargino mass around 100 GeV for a
range of $\tan\beta$ values. We also delineate the regions of parameter space
that would be accessible with the improvements of experimental sensitivity
expected in the near future at Gran Sasso, Super-Kamiokande, and other
facilities such as DUMAND and AMANDA, currently under construction. We conclude
that if neutralinos are present in the halo, then this technique can be used to
eventually explore more than half of the allowed parameter space of these

many ways surpassing the reach of traditional collider experiments.

show that quantization is not unique, but depends on a nonnegative parameter
$\lambda$. $1/\lambda$ is the penetration depth of the fields into the medium
in the exterior of $D$. For $\lambda=0$, there are edge observables and edge
states localized at the boundary $\partial D$ for the MCS system. They describe
the affine Lie group $\tilde{L}U(1)$. Their excitations carry zero energy

additional infinity of single particle excitations of exactly the same energy

for $\lambda=0$ has the huge symmetry group $\tilde{L}U(1) \times U(\infty)$.
In the Maxwell theory, the last mentioned excitations are absent while the edge
observables, which exist for $\lambda=0$, commute. Also these excitations are
described by states which are not localized at $\partial D$ and are
characterized by a continuous and infinitely degenerate spectrum. All these
degeneracies are lifted and edge observables and their states cease to exist
for $\lambda>0$. The novel excitations discovered in this paper should be
