models where they originate in our own Galaxy), the initial energy density is
so large that the resulting relativistic plasma expands with $v\sim c$
producing a blast wave ahead of it and a reverse shock moving into the ejecta,
as it ploughs into the external medium. We evaluate the radiation expected from
these shocks,for both cosmological and galactic bursts, for various assumptions
about the strength of the magnetic field and the particle acceleration
mechanisms in the shocks. The spectra are evaluated over the whole range from
the IR to $>$ GeV, and are compared with the variety of spectral behavior
reported by BATSE, and with the X-ray and optical constraints. For bursts of
duration $\simg 1\s$ acceptable $\gamma$-ray spectra and $L_x/L_\gamma$ ratios
are readily obtained for 'cosmological' models. Blast waves in galactic models
can produce bursts of similar gamma-ray fluence and duration, but they violate
the X-ray paucity constraint, except for the shorter bursts ($\siml 1\s$). We
discuss the prospects for using O/UV and X-ray observations to discriminate
among alternative models.

And calculations show that the order parameter \psibarpsi vanishes above T_c.
It has been popular to refer to this T_c as chiral symmetry restoration
temperature because it fits into our prejudice that chiral symmetry is like an
`ordered' state, and at high T it must become disordered. In fact, NJL ground
state is not an ordered spin state. The recent scenario of a generic class of
disoriented chiral condensate offers an example where \psibarpsi in each little
domain is nonzero, but the average over all space of \psibarpsi vanishes. Such
a dcc ground state continues to break chiral invariance. But how do you
reconcile this with the apparent chiral symmetry at high T? The
Braaten-Pisarski action is a good laboratory to investigate the subtleties of
high temperature chiral symmetry. By carrying out a canonical quantization of
this highly nonlocal action, I demonstrate how the thermal vacuum at high T
conserves the new \beta-chirality but breaks the old T=0 chirality. Lattice
calculations show that the pion develops a screening mass at high T. Our
continuum field theory calculations show that the QCD pion remains massless for
all T. I conclude the talk by showing how the hot pion manages to accomodate
the two results by propagating in the early universe with a halo.

cohomology of supersymmetric Yang-Mills coupled to chiral matter, and the
physically interesting (on-shell) anomalies are those which cannot be
eliminated using the equations of motion. An analysis of this cohomology
problem shows that the simplest situation where a physically interesting
supersymmetry anomaly can arise is when: 1. the anomaly occurs in the
renormalization of a composite antichiral spinor superfield operator
constructed from the chiral matter in the theory, 2. the anomalous diagrams are
one-loop triangle diagrams containing a gauge propagator, 3. the gauge symmetry
(but not supersymmetry) is spontaneously broken, 4. the initial operator has a
dimension such that the triangle diagram is at least linearly divergent, 5. the
anomaly contains only massless chiral superfields, although (apparently harder
to calculate) supersymmetry anomalies can also contain massive chiral
superfields, 6. the theory contains vertices which, after gauge symmetry
breaking, couple massless matter fields to massive matter fields and massive
gauge fields, like the $ e^- \n_e W^+$ vertices of the standard model.
  The supersymmetry anomalies considered here are all `soft', in the sense that
they must vanish when certain masses go to zero. It appears that the order
parameter of the resulting supersymmetry breaking may be the vacuum expectation
value that breaks the gauge symmetry. Nonzero values for the anomalies, if they
exist, appear to generate supersymmetry breaking for observable particles with
