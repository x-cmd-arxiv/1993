superconducts near phase separation in the regime of quarter-filling density,
in agreement with previous results reported by Dagotto and Riera (Phys. Rev.

but a novel transition to s-wave superconductivity is observed decreasing the
electronic density. In addition, the one band t-U-V model has also been studied
using the mean-field approximation that accurately described the spin density
wave phase of the repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling. Finally, the two
band Hubbard model on a chain is also analyzed. Superconducting correlations
near phase separation exist in this model, as it occurs in the t-J model. Based
on these nontrivial examples it is $conjectured$ that electronic models tend to
have superconducting phases in the vicinity of phase separation.Reciprocally,
if it is established that a model that does not phase separate, then its
chances of presenting a superconducting phase are considerably reduced.

describe the struck proton as a wavepacket of physical baryon resonances. The
effects of the wavepacket expansion on the normal component of the ejectile

formalism is also applied to study CT effects in total cross sections,
individual separated nuclear response functions, Fermi motion of the initial
