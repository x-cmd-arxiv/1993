via $W\gamma$ and $WZ$ fusion, as a probe for nonstandard $WW\gamma$ and $WWZ$
vertices at hadron supercolliders. Triggering on events with one very forward
and one very backward jet while requiring the $W$ decay lepton to be central,
strongly enhances the triple gauge boson vertex contribution and suppresses
backgrounds from QCD $Wjj$ events and $t\bar tj$ production below the signal
level. At the SSC, the process is sensitive to $WWV$, $V=\gamma\, ,Z$ couplings
$\kappa_V -1$, $\lambda_V$, and $g_1^Z$ in the $0.03\dots 0.1$ range.

fermions in one space dimension by deriving the bosonized action using
$W_\infty$ coherent states in the fermion path-integral. This action was
earlier derived by us using the method of coadjoint orbits. We also discuss the
classical limit of the bosonized theory and indicate the precise nature of the
truncation of the full theory that leads to the collective field theory.
