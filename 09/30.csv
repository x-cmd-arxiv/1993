defined as a local and quantum-mechanical notion in the sense that it is

Hamiltonian of infinite degrees of freedom. The quantum mechanics and the
theory of general relativity are consistently united in this context if one
uses this notion of local and quantum-mechanical time. As one of the
consequences, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox is resolved. The Hubble
red-shift is explained as a consequence of general relativity which is
consistent with quantum mechanics. This does not require us to argue on the

masses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. Such objects,
known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (MACHOs) might be brown
dwarfs or `Jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),
neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. Paczynski$^6$ suggested that
MACHOs might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing the
apparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. We are
conducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter halo
of our galaxy is made up of MACHOs. Here we report a candidate for a
microlensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 million
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for one year. The light curve shows no
variation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lasting
over 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. The most probable

within the $\pm 5000$ \kms~ range of the emission redshift, and are hence

abundances of $\leq 1$% and $\leq 8$% of solar values at redshifts of 3.0541

expected from previous determinations at lower redshifts, and our data are
hence compatible with earlier conclusions that no evidence is yet found for
chemical evolution of intervening damped and Lyman limit absorbers. For the
\zae~ systems we found indications of metallicities comparable to, and even in
excess of solar values. These much higher values compared to the damped
systems, are in favour of the intrinsic hypothesis for these systems.

accuracy of several analytical approximations for the modeling of large-scale

allowing for direct comparison of the accuracy of various approximations. In
particular, the ``Zel'dovich approximation'' (Zel'dovich 1970, 1973, hereafter

found to provide an excellent approximation to the density field in the mildly
non-linear regime (i.e. up to a linear r.m.s. density contrast of $\sigma
\approx 2$). The performance of ZA in hierarchical clustering models can be
greatly improved by truncating the initial power spectrum (smoothing the
initial data). We here explore whether this approximation can be further
improved with higher-order corrections in the displacement mapping from
homogeneity. We study a single pancake model (truncated power-spectrum with
