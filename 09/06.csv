interactions. Although these anomalous interactions are not renormalizable, the
contributions are cut-off independent. Using recent results from the CLEO
collaboration on inclusive radiative B decays, we obtain bounds for the
anomalous CP conserving and CP violating couplings. The constraints on the CP
conserving couplings are comparable with or better than constraints from other
experiments.

$N$-dimensional root of unity representation of the quantum group. The
invariants for $N>2$ are generalizations of the multi-variable Alexander
polynomial. The invariants vanish for disconnected links. We review the
definition of the invariants through (1,1)-tangles. When $(N,3)=1$ and $N$ is
odd, the invariant does not vanish for the parallel link (cable) of the knot
$3_1$, while the Alexander polynomial vanishes for the cable link.

a Kac-Moody-like algebra. Covariance properties and tensorial composition of
spinors under $S^7$ are defined. The relation to Malcev algebras is
established. The consequences for octonionic projective spaces are examined.
Current algebras are formulated and their anomalies are derived, and shown to
be unique (even regarding numerical coefficients) up to redefinitions of the
currents. Nilpotency of the BRST operator is consistent with one particular
expression in the class of (field-dependent) anomalies. A Sugawara construction
is given.

elliptic potential. The inclusion of a spectral parameter enables us to find
$R$-matrices for the general elliptic potential.
