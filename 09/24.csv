is computed using Fast Fourier Transforms. This leads to an incorrect force

incorrect force is subtracted exactly from all particles in parallel using
convolution with the appropriate Green's function in real space in a time of

correct $1/r^2$ force is added for all neighbouring particles in parallel,
leading to an accurate algorithm which runs efficiently on a highly parallel

Connection Machine 2 with 8MHz clock. This decreases to an estimated 9.8
seconds on a full-sized $64k$ CM200.

gravitational potential has grown only by a factor of order unity. We present
theoretical arguments explaining the origin of this approximate constancy of
gravitational potential. This fact can be exploited to provide a new, powerful,
approximation scheme to study the formation of nonlinear structures in the
universe. The essential idea of this method is to evolve the initial
distribution of particles using a gravitational potential frozen in time
(Frozen Potential Approximation). This approximation provides valuable insight
into understanding various features of nonlinear evolution; for example, it
provides a simple explanation as to why pancakes remain thin during the
evolution even in the absence of any artificial, adhesion-like, damping terms.
We compare the trajectories of particles in various approximations. We also
discuss a few applications of the frozen potential approximation.

temperature at which it occurs change, once $Z(\vph,T)$ is included. But a
non--vanishing, positive (negative) $Z(\vph,T)$ enhances (decreases) the
critical droplet surface tension and the strength of the phase transition. We
find that in the range of parameter space, which allows for a first--order

a weaker phase transition --- and especially for small field values so large
