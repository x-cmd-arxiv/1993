one-dimensional coagulation reaction A+A->A with partial reaction probability
on particle encounters which are otherwise hard-core. The new approximation
describes the crossover from the mean-field rate-equation behavior at short
times to the universal, fluctuation-dominated behavior at large times. The
approximation becomes quantitatively accurate when the system is initially
close to the continuum behavior, i.e., for small initial density and fast
reaction. For large initial density and slow reaction, lattice effects are
nonnegligible for an extended initial time interval. In such cases our
approximation provides the correct description of the initial mean-field as
well as the asymptotic large-time, fluctuation-dominated behavior. However, the
intermediate-time crossover between the two regimes is described only
semiquantitatively.
