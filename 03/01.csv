analytical complex world-line. The equivalence of this complex world-line and
an Euclidean version of complex strings (hyperbolic strings) is discussed. It
is shown that the complex Kerr source satisfies the corresponding string
equations. The boundary conditions of the complex Euclidean strings require an
orbifold-like structure of the world-sheet. The related orbifold-like structure
of the Kerr geometry is discussed.

  93-4","Phys.Rev. D48 (1993) 2800-2805","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.2800",,"hep-ph",,"  For the theory of a single scalar field $\varphi$ with a quartic potential
$V(\varphi)$, we find semi-analytic expressions for the Euclidean action in
both four and three dimensions. The action in four dimensions determines the
quantum tunneling rate at zero temperature from a false vacuum state to the
true vacuum state; similarly, the action in three dimensions determines the
thermal tunneling rate for a finite temperature theory. We show that for all
quartic potentials, the action can be obtained from a one parameter family of
instanton solutions corresponding to a one parameter family of differential
equations. We find the solutions numerically and use polynomial fitting
formulae to obtain expressions for the Euclidean action. These results allow
one to calculate tunneling rates for the entire possible range of quartic
potentials, from the thin-wall (nearly degenerate) limit to the opposite limit
of vanishing barrier height. We also present a similar calculation for
potentials containing $\varphi^4 \ln \varphi^2$ terms, which arise in the
one-loop approximation to the effective potential in electroweak theory.

$TeV$ range in studying an alternative scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking
based on a strong interacting sector. The calculations are performed within the
BESS model which contains new vector resonances. If the mass $M_V$ of the new
boson multiplet lies not far from the maximum machine energy, or if it is
lower, such a resonant contribution would be quite manifest. A result of our
analysis is that also virtual effects are important. It appears that
annihilation into a fermion pair in such machines, at the considered
luminosities, would improve only marginally on existing limits if polarized
beams are available and left-right asymmetries are measured. On the other hand,
the process of $W$-pair production by $e^+e^-$ annihilation would allow for
sensitive tests of the hypothesized strong sector, especially if the $W$
polarizations are reconstructed from their decay distributions, and the more so
the higher the energy of the machine. An $e^+e^-$ collider with c.m. energy
$\sqrt{s}=500~GeV$ could improve the limits on the model for the range
$500<M_V(GeV)<1000$ when $W$ polarization is not reconstructed. If $W$
polarizations are reconstructed, then the bounds improve for the entire
expected range of $M_V$. These bounds become more stringent for larger energy
of the collider. We have also studied the detectability of the new resonances
through the fusion subprocesses, but this channel does not seem to be
interesting even for a collider with a c.m. energy $\sqrt{s}=2~TeV$.

of 2d quantum dilaton gravity is obtained. By evaluating this expression we
establish that the quantum theories which can be written as a Liouville-like
theory, have a lower bound to energy, provided there is no critical boundary.
This fact is then reconciled with the observation made earlier that the Hawking
radiation does not appear to stop. The physical picture that emerges is that of
a black hole in a bath of quantum radiation. We also evaluate the ADM mass for
the models with RST boundary conditions and find that negative values are
allowed. The Bondi mass of these models goes to zero for large retarded times,
but becomes negative at intermediate times in a manner that is consistent with
the thunderpop of RST.
