theorem of algebraic invariants and the notion of positive relative

the supervariety of relative positive superdivisors of degre p (supervortices

discussed as possible space-time models supporting the usual Kruskal
presentation of the vacuum Schwarzschild metric locally, but {\em not
globally}. While having the same topology as the standard Kruskal model, none
of these manifolds is diffeomorphic to standard Kruskal, although under certain
conditions some global smooth Lorentz-signature metric can be continued from
the local Kruskal form. Consequently, it can be conjectured that such manifolds
represent an infinity of physically inequivalent (non-diffeomorphic) space-time
models for black holes. However, at present nothing definitive can be said
about the continued satisfaction of the Einstein equations. This problem is
also discussed in the original Schwarzschild $(t,r)$ coordinates for which the
exotic region is contained in a world tube along the time-axis, so that the
manifold is spatially, but not temporally, asymptotically standard. In this
form, it is tempting to speculate that the confined exotic region might serve
as a source for some exterior solution. Certain aspects of the Cauchy problem
are also discussed in terms of ${\bf R^4_\\Theta}$\ models which are
``half-standard'', say for all $t<0,$ but for which $t$ cannot be globally
smooth.

$\sigma_{\pi N}(0)$ allows to determine the three corresponding finite
low--energy constants and to predict the the two $KN$ $\sigma$--terms
$\sigma^{(1,2)}_{KN} (0)$. We also include the spin-3/2 decuplet in the
effective theory. The presence of the non--vanishing energy scale due to the
octet--decuplet splitting shifts the average octet baryon mass by an infinite
amount and leads to infinite renormalizations of the low--energy constants. The
first observable effect of the decuplet intermediate states to the baryon
masses starts out at order $q^4$. We argue that it is not sufficient to retain
only these but no other higher order terms to achieve a consistent description
of the three--flavor scalar sector of baryon CHPT. In addition, we critically
discuss an SU(2) result which allows to explain the large shift of $\sigma_{\pi
