are diagonalized using a Lanczos algorithm. The behaviour of the binding energy
with system size suggests the existence of a finite critical value of J above
which binding occurs in the bulk. Only the d-wave pair field operator acting on
the Heisenberg GS has a finite overlap with the 2 hole ground state for all the
clusters considered. The related spectral function associated with the
propagation of a d-wave (spin singlet) pair of holes in the antiferromagnetic
background is calculated. The quasiparticle peak at the bottom of the spectrum
as well as some structure appearing above the peak survive with increasing
cluster size. Although no simple scaling law was found for the quasiparticle
weight the data strongly suggest that this weight is finite in the bulk limit
and is roughly proportional to the antiferromagnetic coupling J (for J<1).

phases arising from the charged Higgs exchange in the Weinberg model of CP

rate or energy asymmetries by a factor of $\approx {m_t\over m_\tau}\approx
O(100)$. Thus for optimal values of the parameters the method requires $\approx
10^4$ top pairs to be observable rather than $10^7$ needed for rate or energy
asymmetries. We also examine $\tau$ polarization in b decays via $b \rightarrow
c \nu \tau$ and find that it can also be very effective in constraining the CP
violation parameters of the extended Higgs sector.

supergravity model, which reduces to the minimal supersymmetric standard model.
The model is effectively parametrized in terms of five low energy observables.
In consequence, it is easy to investigate systematically the parameter space of
the model, allowed by the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking and by the present experimental limits. Radiative corrections due to
large Yukawa couplings and particle--sparticle mass splitting are included into
the analysis and found to have important effects, in particular on the degree
of fine tuning in the model. In this framework there are presented the
predictions of the model for various low energy physical observables and their
dependence on the values of the top quark mass and $\tan\beta$ is discussed.
Results are also given for the large $\tan\beta$ scenario, $\tan\beta\approx
m_t/m_b$. Our approach can be easily extended to non--minimal supergravity
models, which do not assume the universality of the soft breaking parameters at
the unification scale $M_X$. Such an extension will be particularly useful once
the masses of some sparticles are known, allowing for a model independent study
of the parameter space at $M_X$.
