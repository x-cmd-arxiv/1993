quantum states. As noted by Grishchuk and Sidorov, the amplification of quantum
fluctuations into macroscopic perturbations which occurs during cosmic
inflation is a process of quantum squeezing. We carefully develop the squeezed
state formalism and derive the equations that govern the evolution of a
gaussian initial state. We derive the power spectrum of density perturbations
for a simple inflationary model and discuss its features. We conclude that the
squeezed state formalism provides an interesting framework within which to
study the amplification process, but,in disagreement with the claims of
Grishchuk and Sidorov, that it does {\em not} provide us with any new physical
results.

gravity of a compact outer marginal surface has an upper bound, attained if and

requirement of perturbative consistency of the top quark Yukawa sector of the
