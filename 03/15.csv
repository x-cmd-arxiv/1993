effects of the environmental density on the presence of bar structures in
spiral galaxies of various morphological types. For an extensive sample of
nearby galaxies, listed in the ``Nearby Galaxies Catalogue'' (Tully, 1988a), we
have found that the spirals characterized by a high local density tend to be
barred if they are early-type and early-type if they are barred (at the
significance level of $\sim$3 sigma), confirming some earlier suggestion of low
statistical significance. This fact, which is observed substantially in
low-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the
formation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in
partial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body
simulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed
between pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which
are often associated with bars. {\it Subject headings:} galaxies: general ---

surface of the high-temperature superconductors remains a significant
unresolved question. Is the phase of the gap constant, does it change sign, or
is it perhaps complex? A detailed answer to this question would provide
important constraints on various pairing mechanisms. Here we propose a new
method for measuring the relative gap PHASE on the Fermi surface which is
direct, is angle-resolved, and probes the bulk. The required experiments
involve measuring phonon linewidths in the normal and superconducting state,
with resolution available in current facilities. We primarily address the
La_1.85Sr_.15CuO_4 material, but also propose a more detailed study of a
specific phonon in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8.

the sea-quark distributions. In addition to much better determination of the
small x dependence of all parton distributions, we found: (i) the strange quark
distribution is much softer than the non-strange sea quarks and rises above the
latter at small-x; and (ii) the difference $\bar d-\bar u$ changes sign as a
function of x. A few alternative sets of viable distributions with conventional

trivial. It has a non-trivial effective potential which leads to spontaneous
symmetry breaking, but the particle excitations above the broken vacuum are
non-interacting. The key to this picture is the realization that the constant
background field (the mode with zero 4-momentum) renormalizes differently from
the fluctuation field (the finite-momentum modes). This picture reconciles
rigorous results and lattice calculations with one-loop and
Gaussian-approximation analyses. Because of ""triviality"", these latter two
methods should be effectively exact. Indeed, they yield the same renormalized
effective potential and the same relation m_h^2 = 8 pi^2 v^2 between the
particle mass and the physical vacuum expectation value. This relation predicts
a Higgs mass m_h about 2 TeV in the standard model. The non-interacting nature
of the scalar sector implies, by the equivalence theorem, that Higgs and gauge
bosons interact only weakly, through their gauge and Yukawa couplings.

corresponding Boolean algebras Borel(R)/(meager sets), Borel(R)/(null sets))
are special, was probably old and widespread. A reasonable interpretation is to
show them unique, or ``minimal'' or at least characteristic in a family of
``nice forcing'' like Borel. We shall interpret ``nice'' as Souslin as
suggested by Judah Shelah [JdSh 292]. We divide the family of Souslin forcing
to two, and expect that: among the first part, i.e. those adding some
non-dominated real, Cohen is minimal (=is below every one), while among the
rest random is quite characteristic even unique. Concerning the second class we
have weak results, concerning the first class, our results look satisfactory.
We have two main results: one (1.14) says that Cohen forcing is ``minimal'' in
the first class, the other (1.10) says that all c.c.c. Souslin forcing have a
property shared by Cohen forcing and Random real forcing, so it gives a weak
answer to the problem on how special is random forcing, but says much on all
c.c.c. Souslin forcing.

forces, the GRS theory can generally be applied to confined systems. When
expressed in the GRS-West kinematic variable y, the response has a standard
asymptotic limit and calculable dominant corrections of orders 1/q,1/q. That
theory therefore clearly demonstrates how constituents, confined before and
after the absorption of the transferred momentum and energy, behave as
asymptotically free particles. We compare the GRS results with those for a
summation method for harmonic and square well confinement and also discuss the
convergence of the GRS series for the response in powers of 1/q.

The usual Hartree-Fock approximation for the nucleon propagator is known to
produce the appearance of complex (ghost) poles which violate basic theorems of
quantum field theory. In a theory with vector mesons there are vertex
corrections that produce a strongly damped vertex function in the ultraviolet.
One set of such corrections is known as the Sudakov form factor in quantum
electrodynamics. When the Sudakov form factor generated by massive neutral
vector mesons is included in the Hartree-Fock approximation to the
Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator, the ghost poles disappear
and consistency with basic requirements of quantum field theory is recovered.
