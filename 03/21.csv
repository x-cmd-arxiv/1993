  (http://www.ma.utexas.edu/mpej)",,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  The parametric equations of KAM tori for a quasi integrable system, are shown
to be one point Schwinger functions of a suitable euclidean quantum field
theory on the torus. KAM theorem is equivalent to a ultraviolet stability
theorem. A renormalization group treatment of the field theory leads to a
resummation of the formal pertubation series and to an expansion in terms of
new parameters (identified as a family of renormalization constants). The new
parameters are analytic in the coupling (at small coupling): the breakdown of
the tori at large coupling is speculated to be related to the crossing of a
""critical"" surface at a value where the renormalization constants are still
finite. A mechanism for the possible universality of the singularities of
parametric equations for the invariant tori, in their parameter dependence as
well as in the coupling dependence, is proposed.}

an irreducible *-representation with respect to some inner product on $V$ then
under appropriate technical conditions this property determines the inner
product uniquely up to a constant factor. Ashtekar has suggested using the
condition that a given representation of the algebra of quantum observables is
a *-representation to fix the inner product on the space of physical states.
This idea is of particular interest for the quantisation of gravity where an
obvious prescription for defining an inner product is lacking. The results of
this paper show rigorously that Ashtekar's criterion does suffice to determine
the inner product in very general circumstances. Two versions of the result are
proved: a simpler one which only applies to representations by bounded
operators and a more general one which allows for unbounded operators. Some
concrete examples are worked out in order to illustrate the meaning and range
of applicability of the general theorems.

$1,\ldots,Q$ ($\sqrt{Q}=q+q^{-1}$) but they have a set of complicated multi

resulting lattice geometry, symmetries, and the detailed examples of $k=2,3$

first order phase transition line, generalizing Baxter's results for $k=1$. For
$Q\leq 4$, we discuss the full phase diagram of the spin one ($k=2$)
anisotropic and ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant quantum spin chain (it
reduces in the limit $Q=4$ ($q=1$) to the much studied phase diagram of the
isotropic spin one quantum chain). Several critical lines and massless phases
are exhibited. The appropriate generalization of the Valence Bond State method
of Affleck et al. is worked out.

  style","Phys.Rev.C48:178-191,1993","10.1103/PhysRevC.48.178",,"nucl-th",,"  We study the quantum foundations of a theory of large amplitude collective
motion for a Hamiltonian expressed in terms of canonical variables. In previous
work the separation into slow and fast (collective and non-collective)
variables was carried out without the explicit intervention of the Born
Oppenheimer approach. The addition of the Born Oppenheimer assumption not only
provides support for the results found previously in leading approximation, but
also facilitates an extension of the theory to include an approximate
description of the fast variables and their interaction with the slow ones.
Among other corrections, one encounters the Berry vector and scalar potential.
The formalism is illustrated with the aid of some simple examples, where the
potentials in question are actually evaluated and where the accuracy of the
Born Oppenheimer approximation is tested. Variational formulations of both
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian type are described for the equations of motion for
the slow variables.
