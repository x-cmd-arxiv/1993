  Singulariteitenproject (European Singularity Project) Nr. 32",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We determine the versal deformation of cones, in the simplest case: cones
over hyperelliptic curves of high degree. In particular, we show that for
degree $4g+4$, the highest degree for which interesting deformations exist, the
number of smoothing components is $2^{2g+1}$ ($g\neq3$).
  We review in a general setting the relation of $T^1(-1)$ with Wahl's Gaussian
map. We prove that $T^1(-1)$ vanishes for a general curve and an arbitrary
embedding line bundle of degree at least $2g+11$. To find $T^2$ for
hyperelliptic cones with the Main Lemma of [Behnke--Christophersen], we compute
$T^1$ for the cone over $d$ points on a rational normal curve of degree
$d-g-1$, using explicit equations. Actually, the equations for the cone over a
hyperelliptic curve have a nice structure. We give an interpretation of
$T^2(-2)$ in terms of this structure.
  Smoothing components are related to surfaces with $C$ as hyperplane section.
An explicit description of the corresponding infinitesimal deformations allowss
to conclude that the base space is a complete intersection of degree
$2^{2g+1}$. We also consider smoothing data in the sense of [Looijenga--Wahl].

dynamics. In the opposite limit the action becomes proportional to 1/a0.
Galilei-invariant such theories must be strongly non-local; this is a blessing,
as such theories need not suffer from the illnesses that are endemic to
higher-derivative theories. We discuss the possibility that such a modified law
of motion is an effective theory resulting from the elimination of degrees of
freedom pertaining to the universe at large (the near equality a0=cH0 being a
trace of that connection). A virial relation for bounded trajectories is
derived. Exact solutions are obtained for circular orbits, which pertain to
rotation curves of disk galaxies. We also explore, in passing, theories that
depart from the conventional

contrasts, on important accounts, with earlier, modified-gravity formulations.

  version now available, see HTML page",,,,"patt-sol adap-org nlin.AO nlin.PS",,"  We study two families of excitable cellular automata known as the
Greenberg-Hastings Model (GHM) and the Cyclic Cellular Automaton (CCA). Each
family consists of local deterministic oscillating lattice dynamics, with
parallel discrete-time updating, parametrized by the range of interaction, the
""shape"" of its neighbor set, threshold value for contact updating, and number
of possible states per site. GHM and CCA are mathematically tractable
prototypes for the spatially distributed periodic wave activity of so-called
excitable media observed in diverse disciplines of experimental science.
Earlier work by Fisch, Gravner, and Griffeath studied the ergodic behavior of
these excitable cellular automata on Z^2, and identified two distinct (but
closely-related) elaborate phase portraits as the parameters vary. In
particular, they noted the emergence of asymptotic phase diagrams (and
Euclidean dynamics) in a well-defined threshold-range scaling limit. In this
study we present several rigorous results and some experimental findings
concerning various phase transitions in the asymptotic diagrams, focusing on
evaluating the limiting threshold cutoff for existence of the spirals that
characterize many excitable media. For mathematical expediency our main results
are formulated in terms of spo(p), the cutoff for existence of stable periodic
objects that arise as spiral cores.

(quasi) solitons. Fluxon dynamical states are well described by a perturbed
sine-Gordon equation model, with boundary conditions determined by the junction
geometry and by externally applied magnetic fields, and they give rise to
readily measurable physical phenomena, such as step structure in
current-voltage characteristics and microwave radiation emission. Devices based
on fluxon propagation offer potentially interesting applications as oscillators
and amplifiers - as well as digital applica- tions, described elsewhere in this
volume - in high performance integrated superconductive circuits.
