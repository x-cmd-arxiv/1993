wires. The presence of a confining potential in addition to the magnetic field
removes the degeneracy of the Landau levels and allows one to associate a group
velocity with each single-particle state. The distribution function describing
the occupation of these single-particle states satisfies a Boltzmann equation,
which may be solved exactly in the case of impurity scattering. In the case
where the electrons scatter against both phonons and impurities we solve
numerically - and in certain limits analytically - the integral equation for
the distribution function, and determine the conductivity as a function of
temperature and magnetic field. The magnetoconductivity exhibits a maximum at a
temperature, which depends on the relative strength of the impurity and
electron-phonon scattering, and shows oscillations when the Fermi energy or the
magnetic field is varied.

  report # KU-HEP-92-25","Phys.Rev.D48:1104-1111,1993","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.1104",,"hep-ph",,"  We introduce a data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments
which is considerably less model dependent than the transparency ratio method.
The new method is based on fitting the shape of the A dependence of the nuclear
cross section at fixed momentum transfer to determine the effective attenuation
cross section for hadrons propagating through the nucleus. The procedure does
not require assumptions about the hard scattering rate inside the nuclear
medium. Instead, the hard scattering rate is deduced directly from the data.
The only theoretical input necessary is in modelling the attenuation due to the
nuclear medium, for which we use a simple exponential law. We apply this
procedure to the Brookhaven experiment of Carroll et al and find that it
clearly shows color transparency: the effective attenuation cross section in
events with momentum transfer $Q^2$ is approximately $40\ mb\ (2.2\
GeV^2/Q^2)$. The fit to the data also supports the idea that the hard
scattering inside the nuclear medium is closer to perturbative QCD predictions
than is the scattering of isolated protons in free space. We also discuss the
application of our approach to electroproduction experiments.

that allow a parameterization and tuning of the leading cutoff effects are
studied both analytically, in the large $N$ limit of the generalization of the
$O(4)$ symmetry of the scalar sector to $O(N)$, and numerically for the
physical case $N = 4$. Combining those results we show that the Minimal
Standard Model will describe physics to an accuracy of a few percent up to
energies of the order 2 to 4 times the Higgs mass, $M_H$, only if $M_H \le 710
\pm 60 ~ GeV$. This bound is the result of a systematic search in the space of
dimension six operators and is expected to hold in the {\it continuum}.

be simply obtained by perturbing around a vacuum without the Dirac sea of

propagator. Consequently, all convergent fermion loop integrals vanish. The
logarithmically divergent two-point loop gives a mass $e/\sqrt\pi$ to the
photon, which turns into the free pointlike boson of the Schwinger model. We
discuss the possiblity of using corresponding expansions to describe charge

procedure of partial gauge fixing of these theories which leads generally to
theories with superconformally extended ${\cal W}$-algebras. The pseudoparticle
model allows one to derive the finite transformations of the gauge and matter
fields occurring in these theories with extended conformal symmetries. In
particular, the partial gauge fixing of the Osp($N|2$) pseudoparticle
mechanical models results in theories with the SO($N$) invariant $N$-extended
superconformal symmetry algebra of Bershadsky and Knizhnik. These algebras are
nonlinear for $N \geq 3.$ We discuss in detail the cases of $N=1$ and $N=2,$
giving two new derivations of the superschwarzian derivatives. Some comments
are made in the $N=2$ case on how twisted and topological theories represent a
significant deformation of the original particle model. The particle model also
allows one to interpret superconformal transformations as deformations of flags
in super jet bundles over the associated super Riemann surface.
