its variants. The approach is largely from first principles, the main aim being
to impart a basic understanding of the relevant theory with an eye to the

status of the model is also critically assessed. The evolution of adiabatic and
isocurvature density perturbations is described, and their effect on the large
scale cmb anisotropy calculated as well as that of any gravitational waves. The
generation of all three types of perturbation during inflation is described,
and the normalisation and spectral indices are calculated in terms of the
inflationary potential and its first and second derivatives. The comparison of
the theory with each type of observation is described, starting with the COBE
data and moving down in scale to the non-linear regime. Constraints on the
spectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation are exhibited, the spectrum
being parametrised by its normalisation and its degree of tilt. Finally
extensions of the CDM model are considered, which replace some of the cold dark
matter by hot dark matter or a cosmological constant.

computing the weak-noise asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the mean
escape time. In this paper we present a general technique for analysing the
weak-noise limit of a wide range of stochastically perturbed continuous-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. We simplify the original problem, which involves
solving a partial differential equation, into one in which only ordinary
differential equations need be solved. This allows us to resolve some old
issues for the case when detailed balance holds. When it does not hold, we show
how the formula for the mean escape time asymptotics depends on the dynamics of
the system along the most probable escape path. We also present new results on
short-time behavior and discuss the possibility of focusing along the escape
path.

well as non-self-similar models. The structure and strength of this singularity
is examined and the question is investigated as to when a non-zero measure set
of non-spacelike trajectories could be emitted from the singularity as opposed
to isolated trajectories coming out. It is seen that the weak energy condition
and positivity of energy density ensures that the families of non-spacelike
trajectories come out of the singularity. The curvature strength of the naked
singularity is examined which provides an important test for its physical
significance and powerful curvature growth near the naked singularity is
pointed out for several subclasses considered. The conditions are discussed for
the naked singularity to be globally naked. Implications for the basic issue of
the final fate of gravitational collapse are considered once the
inhomogeneities in the matter distribution are taken into account. It is argued
that a physical formulation for the cosmic censorship may be evolved which
avoids the features above. Possibilities in this direction are discussed while
indicating that the analysis presented here should be useful for any possible
