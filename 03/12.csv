reviewed and illustrated for Wigner's time delay in elastic scattering of a
point particle from three disks in the plane. The convergence of the cycle
expanded periodic orbit expression for Wigners time delay is demonstrated.
Different regimes in form factor (the Fourier transform of the two point
correlation function) of the semiclassical time delay are identified and their
relation to Berry's semiclassical theory of the spectral rigidity are
discussed.

The minima are generated
using high-temperature Molecular Dynamics and Chain-Growth Monte Carlo
simulations, with subsequent minimization. We find that the lower-energy
configurations are $ \alpha $-helices for a wide range of dielectric constant
values $ (\epsilon = 1,10,80), $ and that there is no noticeable difference
between the distribution of energy minima in $ \phi \psi $ space for different
values of $ \epsilon . $ Ultrametricity tests show that lower-energy $ (\alpha
$ -helical) $ \epsilon =1 $ configurations form a set which is ultrametric to a
certain degree, providing evidence for the presence of fine structure among
those minima. We put forward a heuristic argument for this fine structure. We
also find evidence for ultrametricity of a different kind among $ \epsilon =10
$ and $ \epsilon =80 $ energy minima. We analyze the distribution of lengths of
$ \alpha $-helical portions among the minimized configurations and find a
persistence phenomenon for the $ \epsilon =1 $ ones, in qualitative agreement

(1-q)\,\langle f,g\rangle{\bf1}+q\,a^\dagger(g)a(f)$ for $f,g$ in some Hilbert
space ${\cal H}$ we consider representations generated from a vector $\Omega$
satisfying $a(f)\Omega=\langle f,\phi\rangle\Omega$, where $\phi\in{\cal H}$.
We show that such a representation exists if and only if $\Vert\phi\Vert\leq1$.
Moreover, for $\Vert\phi\Vert<1$ these representations are unitarily equivalent
to the Fock representation (obtained for $\phi=0$). On the other hand
representations obtained for different unit vectors $\phi$ are disjoint. We
show that the universal C*-algebra for the relations has a largest proper,
closed, two-sided ideal. The quotient by this ideal is a natural $q$-analogue
of the Cuntz algebra (obtained for $q=0$). We discuss the Conjecture that, for
$d<\infty$, this analogue should, in fact, be equal to the Cuntz algebra
itself. In the limiting cases $q=\pm1$ we determine all irreducible
representations of the relations, and characterize those which can be obtained
via coherent states.
