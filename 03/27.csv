the decoherence and relaxation processes and use this example to examine 1) the
relation between quantum and thermal fluctuations; and 2) the conditions when
the two basic postulates of quantum statistical mechanics become valid.

principle and perform a Legendre transform to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation
of each theory. Since constraints are present in all these theories, I
construct constraint functions and analyze their Poisson bracket algebra. I
demonstrate, whenever possible, equivalences between the theories.

an attempt is made to extend their analysis to the case of a (massless)

here---for $SL(2,C)$ spinors---that although there are inequivalent forms of
the Dirac equation that can be used to propagate a spinor in a signature
changing spacetime, none of these forms gives rise to a conserved inner product

participate in a long-range electromagnetic interaction in the Higgs phase,

We show that this follows from the fact that the screening charge, induced in
the presence of a Higgs condensate, does not interact with the Aharonov-Bohm
field. The same phenomenon occurs, if a Chern-Simons term is incorporated in
the action. This observation provides a physical basis for the recently
proposed classification of the superselection sectors of this model in terms of
a quasi-Hopf algebra.

For a $U(N)$ gauge group with a background source of Wilson loops, we recover
the collective field Hamiltonian found by Das and Jevicki for the $c=1$ matrix
model, except the spatial coordinate is on a circle. We then proceed to show
that two dimensional QCD with a $U(N)$ gauge group can be reduced to a one-
dimensional unitary matrix model and is hence equivalent to a theory of $N$
free nonrelativistic fermions on a circle. A similar result is true for the
group $SU(N)$, but the fermions must be modded out by the center of mass
coordinate.
