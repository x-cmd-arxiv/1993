already studied this problem in the case n=2 and 3, and Reider had then
attacked it in the case $n=2$ using vector bundle methods based on Bogomolov's

on Bogomolov's theorem on an n-dimensional variety, and on its recent

mean absorption increases with $z$ approximately as a power law
$(1+z)^{\gamma+1}$ with $\gamma = 2.46\pm 0.37$. The mean ratio of \Lya\ to
Lyman $\beta$ absorption in the clouds is $0.476\pm 0.054$. We also detect, and
obtain ratios, for Lyman $\beta$, $\gamma$, and possibly $\epsilon$. We are
also able to quantify the fluctuations of the absorption around its mean, and
find that these are comparable to, or perhaps slightly larger than, that
expected from an uncorrelated distribution of clouds. The techniques in this
paper, which include the use of bootstrap resampling of the quasar sample to
obtain estimated errors and error covariances, and a mathematical treatment of
absorption from a (possibly non-uniform) stochastic distribution of lines,
should be applicable to future, more extensive, data sets.

deduced in our previous paper, yields a measurement of the logarithmic slope of
distribution of \Lya\ clouds in column density $N$. The observed exponential
distribution of the clouds' equivalent widths $W$ is then shown to require a
broad distribution of velocity parameters $b$, extending up to 80 km s$^{-1}$.
We show how the exponential itself emerges in a natural way. An absolute
normalization for the differential distribution of cloud numbers in $z$, $N$,
and $b$ is obtained. By detailed analysis of absorption fluctuations along the
line of sight we are able to put upper limits on the cloud-cloud correlation
function $\xi$ on several megaparsec length scales. We show that observed $b$
values, if thermal, are incompatible, in several different ways, with the
hypothesis of equilibrium heating and ionization by a background UV flux.
Either a significant component of $b$ is due to bulk motion (which we argue
against on several grounds), or else the clouds are out of equilibrium, and
hotter than is implied by their ionization state, a situation which could be
indicative of recent adiabatic collapse.

action whose Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin invariance implies Polyakov's curvature

$SL(2,R)$ Kac-Moody symmetry. The BF degree of freedom turns out be dynamically

fragmentation of single-particle strength for nucleons in finite nuclei
employing the Greens function formalism. The self-energy to be considered in
the Dyson equation for the single-particle Greens function contains all terms
of first (Hartree-Fock) and second order in the residual interaction. It is
demonstrated that the fragmentation of the single-particle strength originating
from the terms of second order can efficiently be described in terms of the
so-called BAGEL approximation. Employing this approximation the self-energy can
be evaluated in a self-consistent way, i.e. the correlations contained in the
Greens function are taken into account for the evaluation of the self-energy.
As an example this scheme is applied to the nucleus $^{16}O$, using a realistic
nucleon nucleon interaction. The effects of the correlations on the occupation
probabilities and the binding energy are evaluated.
