each positive integer $n>1$; the corresponding value of the central charge in
the Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is $c=13-6n-6/n$. The charges
in each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional
\W-algebra. We show that the \W-algebras that arise in this way are symmetries
of Liouville theory for special values of the coupling. We then exhibit a
relationship between the \nls equation and the KP hierarchy. From this it
