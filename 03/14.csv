hidden local symmetries in four-dimensional nonlinear sigma models based on the
coset space $G/H$, with $G$ and $H$ being arbitrary compact groups. Although
the models are non-renormalizable, the proof is done in an analogous manner to
the renormalization proof of gauge theories and two-dimensional nonlinear sigma
models by restricting ourselves to the operators with two derivatives (counting
a hidden gauge boson field as one derivative), i.e., with dimension 2, which
are the only operators relevant to the low energy limit. Through loop-wise
mathematical induction based on the Ward-Takahashi identity for the BRS
symmetry, we solve renormalization equation for the effective action up to
dimension-2 terms plus terms with the relevant BRS sources. We then show that
all the quantum corrections to the dimension-2 operators, including the finite
parts as well as the divergent ones, can be entirely absorbed into a
re-definition (renormalization) of the parameters and the fields in the
dimension-2 part of the tree-level Lagrangian.

A8 (1993) 1909-1916","10.1142/S021773239300163X",,"hep-th cond-mat",,"  We examine an approach to justifying the mean field approximation for the
anyon gas, using the scattering of anyons. Parity violation permits a nonzero
average scattering angle, from which one can extract a mean radius of curvature
for anyons. If this is larger than the interparticle separation, one expects
that the graininess of the statistical magnetic field is unimportant, and that
the mean field approximation is good. We argue that a non-conventional
interaction between anyons is crucial, in which case the criterion for validity
of the approximation is identical to the one deduced using a self-consistency
argument.

pointed out that a staggered localized state can be viewed as a particle of a
{\em negative} effective mass. It is shown that staggered localized states can
exist in the discrete dark NLS. The motion of localized states and
Peierls-Nabarro pinning are studied.
