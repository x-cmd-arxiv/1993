numerically how fractal dimensions cross over from finite-dimensional Brownian
noise at short time scales to finite values of deterministic chaos at longer
time scales for data generated from a Langevin equation that has a strange
attractor in the limit of zero noise. Our results suggest that the crossover
occurs at such short time scales that there is little chance of
finite-dimensional Brownian noise being incorrectly identified as deterministic
chaos.

the phase space where the holonomies are boosts and study its kernel. This
kernel is dense in the connection representation and the transform is not
continuous with respect to the natural topologies, even in its domain of
definition. Nonetheless, loop representations isomorphic to the connection
representation corresponding to this part of the phase space can still be
constructed if due care is taken. We present this construction but note that
certain ambiguities remain; in particular, functions of loops cannot be
uniquely associated with functions of connections.

scalar potential which occurs in models of so called late-time phase
transitions in which domain walls are produced, $\pp$ is shown to evolve from a
Gaussian to a non-Gaussian distribution. The structure of the latter justifies
the recent use of 3-dimensional percolation theory to describe the initial
distribution of domain walls in these models.

at finite temperature. Using an improved perturbation theory, where plasma
masses are determined from a set of one-loop gap equations, we evaluate the
effective potential $V_{eff}(\varphi,T)$ in next-to-leading order, i.e.,
including terms cubic in the gauge coupling $g$, the scalar self-coupling
$\lambda^{1/2}$ and the top-quark Yukawa coupling $f_t$. The gap equations
yield a non-vanishing magnetic plasma mass for the gauge bosons, originating
from the non-abelian self-interactions. We discuss in detail size and origin of
higher order effects and conclude that the phase transition is weakly
first-order up to Higgs masses of about $70\ GeV$, above which our calculation
is no longer self-consistent. For larger Higgs masses even an approximation
containing all $g^4$ contributions to $V_{eff}$ is not sufficient, at least a
full calculation to order $g^6$ is needed. These results turn out to be rather
insensitive to the top-quark mass in the range $m_t=100\ -\ 180\ GeV$. Using
Langer's theory of metastability we calculate the nucleation rate of critical
droplets and discuss some aspects of the cosmological electroweak phase
transition.

  Region","20,DOE-306-CPP-75",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We consider the scattering of Goldstone bosons in the range of intermediate
energies, and in particular focus our attention on the scattering of pions in
the $\rho$-resonance region. The chiral perturbation series is obtained to
order $E^4$ from a chiral $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ invariant effective Lagrangian.
At order $E^4$, we isolate the low-energy manifestation of heavy particle
exchange in the s-channel. We find that the contributions of this type to the
I=1 and I=2 amplitudes have a one parameter dependence. This observation
provides a symmetry rationale for Chanowitz's recent observation that in a
chiral model with an explicitly coupled $\rho$, the I=1 and I=2 channels are
strongly correlated. In order to realize, in a quantitative way, the fact that
in the resonance region the direct-channel dominates, we make use of a simple
and intuitive unitarization scheme. This allows us to derive a renormalization
constant-independent relation for the I=1 and I=2 phase shifts. With the
assumption of a $\rho$-resonance, this relation determines the position of a
pole at euclidean momentum in the I=2 channel. Through an analysis based on the
theory of redundant poles and the Adler sum rule we show that this ``tachyon''
pole actually represents a physical contribution to the unitary amplitude which
accounts for $\rho$ and $\epsilon$ exchange in the u-channel.
