young Universe, and (ii) a recently proposed string-inspired no-scale flipped
$SU(5)$ supergravity model. Our computations span the neutralino, chargino,
slepton, and Higgs sectors together with their interconnections in this class
of models. We find that the number of `mixed' (1-lepton + 2-jets + $\slash{p}$)
events occuring in the decay of pair-produced charginos ($\chi^\pm_1$) is quite
significant (per ${\cal L}=100\ipb$) for both models and that these predictions
do not overlap. That is, if $m_{\chi^\pm_1}<100\GeV$ then LEPII should be able
to exclude at least one of the two models. In the no-scale flipped $SU(5)$
model we find that the number of acoplanar di-electron events from selectron
pair production should allow for exploration of selectron masses up to the
kinematical limit and chargino masses indirectly as high as 150 GeV. We find
that the cross section $e^+e^-\to Z^*h$ deviates negligibly from the SM result
in the minimal model, whereas it can be as much as $1/3$ lower in the flipped
model. The usually neglected invisible mode $h\to\chi^0_1\chi^0_1$ can erode
the preferred $h\to 2\,{\rm jets}$ signal by as much as $40\%$ in these models.
We conclude that the charged slepton sector is a deeper probe than the
chargino/neutralino or Higgs sectors of the flipped $SU(5)$ model at LEPII,
while the opposite is true for the minimal $SU(5)$ model where the slepton
sector is no probe at all.

central extensions of the group of smooth maps from a two dimensional
orientable surface without boundary to a simple complex Lie group G. These
extensions naturally correspond to complex curves. The kernel of such an
extension is the Jacobian of the curve. The study of the coadjoint action shows
that its orbits are labelled by moduli of holomorphic principal G-bundles over
the curve and can be described in the language of partial differential
equations. In genus one it is also possible to describe the orbits as conjugacy
classes of the twisted loop group, which leads to consideration of difference
equations for holomorphic functions. This gives rise to a hope that the
described groups should possess a counterpart of the rich representation theory
that has been developed for loop groups. We also define a two-dimensional
analogue of the Virasoro algebra associated with a complex curve. In genus one,
a study of a complex analogue of Hill's operator yields a description of
invariants of the coadjoint action of this Lie algebra. The answer turns out to
be the same as in dimension one: the invariants coincide with those for the
extended algebra of currents in sl(2).

Massless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves the
Super-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductory
review of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagrams
from leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is then
shown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-regge
amplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction of
general reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is argued
that, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can be
reached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouples
fundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied is
the restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by the
exponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contribution

$\rho-\omega$ mixing amplitude to the pseudoscalar sector. The $\pi\!-\!\eta$
mixing amplitude is calculated in a hadronic model where the mixing is driven
by the neutron-proton mass difference. Closed-form analytic expressions are
presented in terms of a few nucleon-meson parameters. The observed momentum
dependence of the mixing amplitude is strong enough as to question earlier
calculations of charge-symmetry-breaking observables based on the on-shell
assumption. The momentum dependence of the $\pi\!-\!\eta$ amplitude is,
however, practically identical to the one recently predicted for $\rho-\omega$
mixing. Hence, in this model, the ratio of pseudoscalar to vector mixing
amplitudes is, to a good approximation, a constant solely determined from
nucleon-meson coupling constants. Furthermore, by selecting these parameters in
accordance with charge-symmetry-conserving data and SU(3)-flavor symmetry, we
reproduce the momentum dependence of the $\pi\!-\!\eta$ mixing amplitude
predicted from chiral perturbation theory. Alternatively, one can use
chiral-perturbation-theory results to set stringent limits on the value of the
$NN\eta$ coupling constant.
