thirty decades of magnitude. The energy spectrum in the far-dissipation range

For values of $m$ that emphasize the far-dissipation range, the fields

gentle spatial variations of the lower-$k$ part of the velocity field. DIA

Averaging over an ensemble of DIA solutions, suggested by the observed
intermittency, removes some of the discrepancy.

relationship for ``dirty'' black holes --- black holes in interaction with
various classical matter fields, distorted by higher derivative gravity, or
infested with various forms of quantum hair. In many cases it is found that the
entropy is simply related to the area of the event horizon: S = k
A_H/(4\ell_P^2). For example, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *holds* for:
Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstrom, Kerr--Newman, and dilatonic black holes. On
the other hand, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *fails* for: various types of
(Riemann)^n gravity, Lovelock gravity, and various versions of quantum hair.
The pattern underlying these results is less than clear. This paper
systematizes these results by deriving a general formula for the entropy: S =
{k A_H/(4\ell_P^2)}
  + {1/T_H} \int_\Sigma [rho - {L}_E ] K^\mu d\Sigma_\mu
  + \int_\Sigma s V^\mu d\Sigma_\mu. (K^\mu is the timelike Killing vector,
V^\mu the four velocity of a co--rotating observer.) If no hair is present the
validity of the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law reduces to the question of whether
or not the Lorentzian energy density for the system under consideration is
formally equal to the Euclideanized Lagrangian. ****** To appear in Physical
