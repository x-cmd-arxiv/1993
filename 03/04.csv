drive a structural distortion in two different ways, either due to spin-orbit

earlier to describe the coupled electron -- octahedral tilt motions (`cageons')

(similar to the high-temperature tetragonal phase of LSCO) to an intermediate
temperature dynamic JT phase, of average orthorhombic symmetry (the LTO phase)
to a low temperature static JT phase (the low temperature tetragonal phase).
For some parameter values, the static JT phase is absent.
