is proposed to study the increase of dynamical complexity: Artificial ""birds""
display a ""song"" time series to each other, and those that imitate the other's
song better win the game. With the introduction of population dynamics
according to the score of the game and the mutation of parameters for the song
dynamics, the dynamics is found to evolve towards the borderline between chaos
and a periodic window, after punctuated equilibria. The importance of edge of
chaos with topological chaos for complexity is stressed.

studied. A local phase slip affects globally the system, which is in strong
contrast with kink propagation. Attractors with different velocities coexist,
and form quantized bands determined by the number of phase slips. The mechanism
and statistical and dynamical characters are studied with the use of spatial
asymmetry, basin volume ratio, Lyapunov spectra, and mutual information. If the
system size is not far from an integer multiple of the selected wavelength,
attractors are tori, while weak chaos remains otherwise, which induces chaotic
modulation of waves or a chaotic itinerancy of traveling states. In the
itinerancy, the residence time distribution obeys the power law distribution,
implying the existence of a long-ranged correlation. Supertransients before the
formation of traveling waves are noted in the high nonlinearity regime. In the
weaker nonlinearity regime corresponding to the frozen random pattern, we have
found fluctuation of domain sizes and Brownian-like motion of domains.
Propagation of chaotic domains by phase slips is also found. Relevance of our
discoveries to B\'{e}nard convection experiments and possible applications to
information processing are briefly discussed.

coupled to Ising spins or Gaussian scalar fields by means of numerical
simulations.
  The quantum gravity part is modelled by the summation over random simplicial
manifolds, and the matter fields are located in the center of the 4-simplices,
which constitute the building blocks of the manifolds. We find that the
coupling between spin and geometry is weak away from the critical point of the
Ising model. At the critical point there is clear coupling, which qualitatively
agrees with that of gaussian fields coupled to gravity. In the case of pure
gravity a transition between a phase with highly connected geometry and a phase
with very ``dilute'' geometry has been observed earlier. The nature of this
transition seems unaltered when matter fields are included.
  It was the hope that continuum physics could be extracted at the transition
between the two types of geometries. The coupling to matter fields, at least in
the form discussed in this paper, seems not to improve the scaling of the
curvature at the transition point.
