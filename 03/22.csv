Fermi liquid theory. It has been proposed that a dynamically generated gauge
field must appear in the effective field theory. Even a simple spinon-gauge
system is complicated, becoming strongly coupled at low energy. We show that in
a large-$n$ approximation the theory can be solved and has a nontrivial fixed
point. Also, we find that there is no antiferromagnetic instability at weak
coupling.

  FERMILAB-Pub-93/057-A","Phys.Rev.Lett.72:17-20,1994","10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.17",,"hep-ph astro-ph",,"  The simplest model that can accomodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter
candidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed
or sterile neutrinos. We reexamine this model and find that the sterile
neutrinos can be either hot, warm, or cold dark matter. Since their only direct
coupling is to left-handed or active neutrinos, the most efficient production
mechanism is via neutrino oscillations. If the production rate is always less
than the expansion rate, then these neutrinos will never be in thermal
equilibrium. However, enough of them may be produced so that they provide the
missing mass necessary for closure. We consider a single generation of neutrino
fields $\left (\nu_L,\,\nu_R\right )$ with a Dirac mass, $\mu$, and a Majorana
mass for the right-handed components only, $M$. For $M\gg \mu$ we show that the
number density of sterile neutrinos is proportional to $\mu^2/M$ so that the
energy density today is {\it independent of} $M$. However $M$ is crucial in
determining the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular, $M\simeq
0.1-1.0 {\rm ~keV}$ leads to warm dark matter and a structure formation
scenario that may have some advantages over both the standard hot and cold dark
matter scenarios.

than or equal to one are considered. The single valued description of anyons is
employed through out by coupling bosons to a Chern-Simons field. At the end,
the Chern-Simons interaction is removed by a singular gauge transformation as a
result of which the wave functions become multi-component in agreement with
other studies.

  Macroscopic Limits","ITP.SB-93-14,19 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.48.898",,"hep-th",,"  In this papper, a quantum dynamical model describing the quantum measurement
process is presented as an extensive generalization of the Coleman-Hepp model.
In both the classical limit with very large quantum number and macroscopic
limit with very large particle number in measuring instrument, this model
generally realizes the wave packet collapse in quantum measurement as a
consequence of the Schrodinger time evolution in either the exactly-solvable
case or the non-(exactly-)solvable case.
  For the latter, its quasi-adiabatic case is explicitly analysed by making use
of the high-order adiabatic approximation method and then manifests the wave
packet collapse as well as the exactly-solvable case. By highlighting these
analysis, it is finally found that an essence of the dynamical model of wave
packet collapse is the factorization of the Schrodinger evolution other than
the exact solvability. So many dynamical models including the well-known ones
before, which are exactly-solvable or not, can be shown only to be the concrete
realizations of this factorizability
