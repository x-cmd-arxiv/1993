the spherically symmetric general relativistic equations in comoving,

homogeneous and nonexpanding. In a radiation- dominated universe, we find that
radiation diffuses into the void at approximately the speed of light as a
strong shock---the void collapses. We also find the surprising result that the
cosmic collapse time (the $1^{\rm st}$-crossing time) is much smaller than
previously thought, because it depends not only on the radius of the void, but
also on the ratio of the temperature inside the void to that outside. If the
ratio of the initial void radius to the outside Hubble radius is less than the
ratio of the outside temperature to that inside, then the collapse occurs in
less than the outside Hubble time. Thus, superhorizon-sized relativistic void
may thermalize and homogenize relatively quickly. These new simulations revise
the current picture of superhorizon-sized void evolution after first-order
inflation.

possibility by studying the renormalization group equations for the Yukawa
couplings of SM with one and two Higgs doublets, by evolving them from given
physical values at low energies ($E \simeq 1 GeV$) to $\E_{tr}$ ($ \sim
\E_{pole}$) and comparing the resulting fermion masses and CKM matrix elements

expectation values. We find that the minimal SM and the closely related SM with
two Higgs doublets (type I) show increasing deviation from FD when energy is
increased, but that SM with two Higgs doublets (type II) clearly tends to FD
with increasing energy - in both the quark and the leptonic sector (q-q and l-l
FD). Furthermore, we find within the type II model that, for $\E_{pole} \ll
\E_{Planck}$, $m_t^{phy}$ can be less than $200 GeV$ in most cases of chosen
$v_u/v_d$. Under the assumption that also the corresponding Yukawa couplings in
the quark and the leptonic sector at $E \simeq \E_{tr}$ are equal (l-q FD), we
derive estimates of bounds on masses of top quark and tau-neutrino, which are
