the corresponding binary Huffman codeword can be very different from the value
-log p. We show that, nevertheless, for a typical letter, l is approximately
equal to -log p. More precisely, the probability that l differs from -log p by
more than m decreases exponentially with m.

transformation, a prototype of an area-conserving chaotic map. By numerically
simulating the perturbed evolution, we estimate the information needed to
follow a perturbed Hilbert-space vector in time. We find that the Landauer
erasure cost associated with this information grows very rapidly and becomes
much larger than the maximum statistical entropy given by the logarithm of the
dimension of Hilbert space. The quantum baker's map thus displays a
hypersensitivity to perturbations that is analogous to behavior found earlier
in the classical case. This hypersensitivity characterizes ``quantum chaos'' in
a way that is directly relevant to statistical physics.

vacuum structure in QCD at finite temperature and baryon density. Using
thermofield dynamics, the parameters of thermal vacuum and the gluon condensate
function are determined through minimisation of the thermodynamic potential,
along with a self-consistent determination of the effective gluon and quark
masses. The scale parameter for the gluon condensates is related to the SVZ
parameter in the context of QCD sum rules at zero temperature. With inclusion
of quarks in the thermal vacuum the critical temperature at which the gluon
condensate vanishes decreases as compared to that containing only gluons. At
zero temperature, we similarly obtain the critical baryon density for the same
to be about 0.36 fm$^{-3}$.

structure of the Standard Model, is also a root for the Clifford algebra of
(1,9)-space-time. A conventional Dirac Lagrangian, employing the (1,9)-Dirac
operator acting on the Standard Model hyperfield, gives rise to matter into
antimatter transitions not mediated by any gauge field. These transitions are
eliminated by restricting the dependencies of the components of the hyperfield
on the extra six dimensions, which appear in this context as a complex triple.
