coordinate transformations and can be used to compute any ergodic average. It
is the most stringent test between theory and experiment, but so far it has
proven difficult to extract from experimental data. It is shown that the main
difficulty is a dephasing of the experimental orbit which can be corrected by
reconstructing the dynamics from several time series. From the reconstructed
dynamics the scaling function can be accurately extracted.

conformal sigma models. They can be viewed as two possibilities of constructing
a conformal model out of the non-conformal one based on the metric of a
$D$-dimensional homogeneous $G/H$ space. The first possibility is to introduce
two extra dimensions (one space-like and one time-like) and to impose the null
Killing symmetry condition on the resulting $2+D$ dimensional metric. In the
case when the ``transverse"" model is $n=2$ supersymmetric and the $G/H$ space
is K\""ahler-Einstein the resulting metric-dilaton background can be found
explicitly. The second possibility - which is realised in the sigma models
corresponding to $G/H$ conformal theories - is to deform the metric,
introducing at the same time a non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor
backgrounds. The expressions for the metric and dilaton in this case are
derived using the operator approach in which one identifies the equations for
marginal operators of conformal theory with the linearised (near a background)
expressions for the `$\b$-functions'. Equivalent results are then reproduced in
the direct field-theoretical approach based on computing first the effective
action of the $G/H$ gauged WZW model and then solving for the $2d$ gauge field.
Both the bosonic and the supersymmetric cases are discussed. ( To be published

"hep-th/9303066","Pavel Etingof","Pavel Etingof","Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and holomorphic vector bundles","23 pages, no figures",,,,"hep-th math.QA",,"  The paper introduces a new geometric interpretation of the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations introduced in 1991 by I.Frenkel and
N.Reshetikhin. It turns out that these equations can be linked to certain
holomorphic vector bundles on the N-th Cartesian power of an elliptic curve.
These bundles are naturally constructed by a gluing procedure from a system of
trigonometric quantum affine $R$-matrices. Meromorphic solutions of the quantum
KZ equations are interpreted as sections of such a bundle. This interpretation
is an analogue of the interpretation of solutions of the classical KZ equations
as sections of a flat vector bundle. Matrix elements of intertwiners between
representations of the quantum affine algebra correspond to regular
(holomorphic) sections. The vector bundle obtained from the quantum KZ system
is topologically nontrivial. Its topology can be completely described in terms
of crystal bases, using the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. In the case N=2,
this bundle is is essentially a bundle on an elliptic curve which is shown to
be semistable (for the case of quantum sl(2)) if the parameters take generic
values. The proof makes use of the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. Finally, we
give a vector bundle interpretation of the generalized quantum KZ equations for
arbitrary affine root systems defined recently by Cherednik.

studied in detail for a class of backgrounds that correspond to general
quadratic boundary interactions on the world-sheet. A short-distance cut-off is
introduced to formulate the theory with a finite number of local and
potentially unrenormalizable boundary couplings. It is shown that
renormalization of the boundary couplings makes both the world-sheet partition
function and the string field action finite and cut-off independent, although
the resulting string field action has an unpalatable dependence on the leading
unrenormalizable coupling.
