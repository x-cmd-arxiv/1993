  required), no figures, MPIfR Preprint No. 521",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 GeV and
10^4 GeV following the earlier papers of this series. We use the basic concept
that the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels
through the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the
presence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic
cooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here
assumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result
is a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields
a spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then
leads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as
observed. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is
determined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of
electron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since
the highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it
depends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to
reach higher energies.

  the authors), UCTTUM-93-01","Phys. Rev. B 48 (1993) 186","10.1103/PhysRevB.48.186",,"cond-mat",,"  In isotropic systems below the transition temperature, the massless Goldstone
modes imply critical infrared singularities in the statics and dynamics along
the entire coexistence curve. We examine the important question whether these
coexistence anomalies are of relevance also in more realistic systems
displaying anisotropies. By applying a generalized renormalization scheme to
the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau models, we treat two quite different but
characteristic cases, namely the influence of (i) weak cubic anisotropies, and
(ii) long-range dipolar interactions. In the presence of cubic terms, the
transverse excitations acquire a mass and thus one expects the theory to
approach an uncritical ""Gaussian"" regime in the limit ${\vec q} \rightarrow 0$
and $\omega \rightarrow 0$. Therefore, we first consider the one-component case
in order to show that our formalism also provides a consistent description of
the crossover into an asymptotically Gaussian theory. In the case of (weak)
cubic anisotropies, the fact that for $n < 4$ the fluctuations tend to restore
the $O(n)$-symmetry at the critical point proves to be most important, since
under these circumstances coexistence-type singularities may be found in an
intermediate wavenumber and frequency range. The dipolar interaction induces an
anisotropy in momentum space, which does not completely destroy the massless
character of the transverse fluctuations, but only effectively reduces the
number of Goldstone modes by one. Remarkably, similar to the isotropic case the
asymptotic theory can be treated exactly. For $n \geq 3$ we find coexistence
anomalies governed by the isotropic power laws. However, the amplitudes of the
respective scaling functions depend on the angle between order parameter and
external wavevector.

played by energy estimates in unweighted Sobolev spaces for a wave equation
satisfied by the second fundamental form of a maximal foliation.
