For d=1, the model becomes identical to the directed polymer in a random

previously to study the interface problem, and extract the behavior in the
double limit epsilon small and N large, finding non-analytic corrections in
1/N. For short-range disorder, the interface width scales as a power law of the
width. We calculate the roughness exponent characterizing this power law for
small epsilon and large N, as well as other properties of the phase. We also
analyze the behavior for disorder with long-range correlations, as is
appropriate for interfaces in random field systems, and study the crossover

mathematical framework for addressing and solving many of the issues of

characterizing the asymptotic distribution of combinatorially inequivalent
triangulated $3$-manifolds, as the number of tetrahedra diverges. Moreover, we
offer a rather detailed presentation of how spaces of three-dimensional
riemannian manifolds with natural bounds on curvatures, diameter, and volume
can be used to prove that three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is
connected to a Gaussian model determined by the simple homotopy types of the
underlying manifolds. This connection is determined by a Gaussian measure
defined over the general linear group $GL({\bf R},\infty)$. It is shown that
the partition function of three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is
well-defined, in the thermodynamic limit, for a suitable range of values of the
gravitational and cosmological coupling constants. Such values are determined
by the Reidemeister-Franz torsion invariants associated with an orthogonal
representation of the fundamental groups of the set of manifolds considered.
The geometrical system considered shows also critical behavior, and in such a
case the partition function is exactly evaluated and shown to be equal to the
Reidemeister-Franz torsion. The phase structure in the thermodynamical limit is
also discussed. In particular, there are either phase transitions describing
the passage from a simple homotopy type to another, and (first order) phase
transitions within a given simple homotopy type which seem to confirm, on an
analytical ground, the picture suggested by numerical simulations.
