  MPIfR Preprint #518",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Using the concept developed in earlier papers, that the cosmic rays originate
in three different main sites, a) the normal supernova explosions into the
interstellar medium, b) the supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and c)
powerful radio galaxies, we demonstrate in this paper that the spectrum and
chemical abundances above $10^4$ GeV can be well understood. Using existing
data on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a
constraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data
from the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all
particle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the
cosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive
the all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data
which allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range
above $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition
and spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies
required from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the
preexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of
$10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by
heavy nuclei such as Neon and higher. The bump observed in the all particle
spectrum below the knee gets weakened with the proper treatment of the energy
dependent chemical composition. For high energies we obtain an estimate of the
extragalactic proton flux.

advancement rate which is related to the time duration of flame motion between

removed by inclusion of smaller eddys which reside between the larger eddys.
This large-eddy, small-eddy concept yields a recursion relation and repeated
functional iteration can be done to approximate a desired flame speed relation.
As an example, an iteration to produce $S_T \ln S_T = u'$ is given for the
range of $u'$ observed in liquid flames. Currently, the iteration process is a
post-diction of flame speed, but if a universality can be developed, then a

the spectra of classical and semiclassical time evolution operators have been
studied for the open three disk billiard. We present evidence that both the
classical and the semiclassical Selberg zeta function have poles. Applying a
Pad\'{e} approximation on the expansions of the full Euler products, as well as
on the individual dynamical zeta functions in the products, we calculate the
leading poles and the zeros of the improved expansions with the first few poles
removed. The removal of poles tends to change the simple linear exponential
convergence of the Selberg zeta functions to an $\exp\{-n^{3/2}\}$ decay in the
classical case and to an $\exp\{-n^2\}$ decay in the semiclassical case. The
leading poles of the $j$th dynamical zeta function are found to equal the
leading zeros of the $j+1$th one: However, in contrast to the zeros, which are
all simple, the poles seem without exception to be {\em double}\/. The poles
are therefore in general {\em not}\/ completely cancelled by zeros, which has
earlier been suggested. The only complete cancellations occur in the classical
Selberg zeta function between the poles (double) of the first and the zeros
(squared) of the second dynamical zeta function. Furthermore, we find strong
indications that poles are responsible for the presence of spurious zeros in
periodic orbit quantized spectra and that these spectra can be greatly improved
by removing the leading poles, e.g.\ by using the Pad\'{e} technique.

mixing-angle. In the presence of an extra pseudo-anomalous gauged- ${U(1)}_X$,
the value of the weak angle may be computed purely in terms of the charges of
the massless fermions of the theory, independently of the details of the
massive string sector. I present the simplest such $ {U(1)}_X$ which leads to
the canonical result $sin^2\theta _W=3/8$ in the supersymmetric standard model.
This is a sort of gauged Peccei-Quinn symmetry which requires the presence of
just the minimal set of Higgs doublets and forbids dimension-four $B$ and
$L$-violating terms. In this approach the cancellation of the $U(1)_X$
anomalies through a Green-Schwarz mechanism plays a crucial role. In a
different context (that of non-string low-energy supersymmetric models) I
briefly discuss wether this type of anomaly cancellation mechanism could be of
