aggregates (e.g. sum of scalar, vector, bivector). This is equivalent to multi-
spinors constructed of Dirac matrices, with the representation independent form
of the generators geometrically interpreted as the basis vectors of spacetime.
Multiple generations of particles appear as left ideals of the algebra, coupled
only by now-allowed right-side applied (dextral) operations. A generalized
bilateral (two-sided operation) coupling is proposed which includes the above
mentioned dextrad field, and the spin-gauge interaction as particular cases.
This leads to a new principle of {\it poly-dimensional covariance}, in which
physical laws are invariant under the reshuffling of coordinate geometry. Such
a multigeometric superfield equation is proposed, which is sourced by a
bilateral current. In order to express the superfield in representation and
coordinate free form, we introduce Eddington E-F {\it double-frame} numbers.
Symmetric tensors can now be represented as 4D ``dyads"", which actually are
elements of a global 8D Clifford algebra. As a restricted example, the dyadic
field created by the Greider-Ross multivector current (of a Dirac electron)
describes both electromagnetic and Morris- Greider gravitational interactions.

models and their predictions. These two models represent an example of a direct
comparison between a traditional unified-theory and a string-inspired approach
to the solution of the many open problems of the Standard Model. We emphasize
that viable models must satisfy {\em all} available experimental constraints

models, $SU(5)$ and $SU(5)\times U(1)$, can be described in terms of only a few
parameters (five and three respectively) instead of the more than twenty needed
in the MSSM model, \ie, the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model. A case of special interest is the strict no-scale $SU(5)\times U(1)$
supergravity where all predictions depend on only one parameter (plus the
top-quark mass). A general consequence of these analyses is that supersymmetric
particles can be at the verge of discovery, lurking around the corner at
present and near future facilities. This review should help anyone distinguish
between well motivated predictions and predictions based on arbitrary choices

variation of the effective gauge action mainly consists of two terms. One comes
from the induced Chern-Simons term and the other from the chiral fermions,
bound to the 1+1 dimensional wall, and they are expected to cancel each other.
Though there exist arguments in favour of this, based on the possible forms of
the effective action valid far from the wall and some facts about theories of
chiral fermions in 1+1 dimensions, a complete calculation is lacking. In this
paper we present an explicit calculation of this cancellation at one loop valid
even close to the wall. We show that, integrating out the ``massive'' modes of
the theory does produce the Chern-Simons term, as appreciated previously. In
addition we show that it generates a term that softens the high energy
