which are of this type.

  LaTeX 2.09 (AAS preprint substyle v3.0)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate asymptotic convergence in the~$\Delta x \!\rightarrow\! 0$
limit as a tool for determining whether numerical computations involving shocks
are accurate. We use one-dimensional operator-split finite-difference schemes
for hydrodynamics with a von Neumann artificial viscosity. An internal-energy
scheme converges to demonstrably wrong solutions. We associate this failure
with the presence of discontinuities in the limiting solution. Our extension of
the Lax-Wendroff theorem guarantees that certain conservative, operator-split
schemes converge to the correct continuum solution. For such a total-energy
scheme applied to the formation of a single shock, convergence of a Cauchy
error approaches the expected rate slowly. We relate this slowness to the
effect of varying diffusion, due to varying linear artificial-viscous length,
on small-amplitude waves. In an appendix we discuss the scaling of
shock-transition regions with viscous lengths, and exhibit several difficulties
for attempts to make extrapolations.

  J.Baez, Oxford U.Press)",,,,"gr-qc alg-geom hep-th math.AG",,"  Integral calculus on the space of gauge equivalent connections is developed.
Loops, knots, links and graphs feature prominently in this description. The
framework is well--suited for quantization of diffeomorphism invariant theories
of connections.
  The general setting is provided by the abelian C* algebra of functions on the
quotient space of connections generated by Wilson loops (i.e., by the traces of
holonomies of connections around closed loops). The representation theory of
this algebra leads to an interesting and powerful ``duality'' between
gauge--equivalence classes of connections and certain equivalence classes of
closed loops. In particular, regular measures on (a suitable completion of)
connections/gauges are in 1--1 correspondence with certain functions of loops
and diffeomorphism invariant measures correspond to (generalized) knot and link
invariants. By carrying out a non--linear extension of the theory of
cylindrical measures on topological vector spaces, a faithful, diffeomorphism
invariant measure is introduced. This measure can be used to define the Hilbert
space of quantum states in theories of connections. The Wilson--loop
functionals then serve as the configuration operators in the quantum theory.

formalism are found to satisfy four relations at second order in flavor
breaking. As a result, the one-loop corrections from Lagrangian terms up to
first order in flavor breaking are observed to give finite and calculable
corrections to these relations. The formal expressions for these corrections
are presented, followed by numerical evaluations. We find consistency between
the experimental values of breaking of the relations and the loop corrections
of these relations as predicted by chiral perturbation theory.

understanding except for ladder-operator and displacement-operator squeezed

generalized minimum-uncertainty squeezed states, give examples, and relate it
to known concepts. I comment on the remaining concept, that of general
displacement-operator squeezed states.
