briefly reviewed. The clustering is extended to nonlinear dynamics on
hypercubic lattices, which enables us to construct a self-organizing genetic
algorithm. A mechanism of maintenance of diversity, ``homeochaos"", is given in
an ecological system with interaction among many species. Homeochaos provides a
dynamic stability sustained by high-dimensional weak chaos. A novel mechanism
of cell differentiation is presented, based on dynamic clustering. Here, a new

persisted for the last decade. The standard hydrostatic-isothermal model for
clusters predicts that the parameter $\beta_{spec} = \sigma_{r}^{2}/(kT/\mu
m_{p})$, which describes the ratio of energy per unit mass in galaxies to that
in the gas, should equal the parameter $\beta_{fit}$ (where $\rho_{gas}(r)
\propto \rho_{gal}(r)^{\beta_{fit}}$) determined from the X-ray surface
brightness distribution. The observations suggest an apparent discrepancy :
$\beta_{spec} \sim 1.2$ (i.e., the galaxies are ``hotter'' than the gas) while
$\beta_{fit} \sim 0.65$ (i.e., the gas is ``hotter'' and more extended than the
galaxies). Here we show that the discrepancy is resolved when the actual
observed galaxy distribution in clusters is used, $\rho_{gal}(r) \propto
r^{-2.4 \pm 0.2}$, instead of the previously assumed steeper King
approximation, $\rho_{gal}(r) \propto r^{-3}$. Using a large sample of
clusters, we find best-fit mean values of $\beta_{spec} = 0.94 \pm 0.08$ and
$\beta_{fit}^{corrected} = 1.25 \times \beta_{fit} = 0.84 \pm 0.10$. These
results resolve the $\beta$ - discrepancy and provide support for the

For positive energy scalar fields with any dynamics, the bending of light by a
weakly gravitating system (galaxy or cluster) is always smaller than the
bending predicted by general relativity for the mass of visible and hitherto
undetected matter (but excluding the scalar field energy). The same conclusion
obtains within general relativity if a nonnegligible part of the mass in
clusters is in coherent scalar fields, {\it i.e.\/} Higgs fields. Thus the
observational claim that clusters of galaxies deflect light much more strongly
than would be expected from the observable matter contained by them, cannot be
interpreted in terms of some scalar-tensor unconventional gravity theory with
no dark matter. If the observations eventually show that the matter
distribution inferred via general relativity from the lensing is very much like
that determined from the dynamics of test objects, then scalar--tensor
unconventional gravity will be irrelevant for understanding the mass
discrepancy in clusters. However, even a single system in which the dynamically
determined mass significantly exceeds the lensing mass suggested by general
relativity, would be very problematic for the dark matter picture, but would be
entirely consistent with unconventional scalar--tensor gravity.

hierarchy a number of new integrable systems are derived including hierarchies
of Kundu-Eckhaus equation and higher order nonlinear extensions of
Yajima-Oikawa and Melnikov hierarchy. In the multicomponent case such gauge
freedom generates novel multicomponent as well as vector generalisations of the
above systems, while the constrained modified KP hierarchy is found to yield
another set of equations like derivative NLS, Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation and
chen-Lee-Liu equation depending on the gauge choice.

  University of Arizona preprint, Number unassigned",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.49.1999",,"nucl-th",,"  We apply the Lee-Suzuki iteration method to calculate the linked-folded
diagram series for a new Nijmegen local NN potential. We obtain an exact
starting-energy-independent effective two-body interaction for a multi-shell,
no-core, harmonic-oscillator model space. It is found that the resulting
effective-interaction matrix elements can be well approximated by the Brueckner
G-matrix elements evaluated at starting energies selected in a simple way.
These starting energies are closely related to the energies of the initial
two-particle states in the ladder diagrams. The ``exact'' and approximate
effective interactions are used to calculate the energy spectrum of 6Li in
order to test the utility of the approximate form.

ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The following processes are taken into
account: thermal gluon decay (g to ibar i), gluon fusion (g g to ibar i), and
quark-antiquark annihilation (jbar j to ibar i), where i and j represent quark
species. We use the thermal quark masses, $m_i^2(T)\simeq m_i^2 + (2g^2/9)T^2$,
in all the rates. At small mass ($m_i(T)<2T$), the production is largely
dominated by the thermal gluon decay channel. We obtain numerical and analytic
solutions of one-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion of an initially pure glue
plasma. Our results show that even in a quite optimistic scenario, all quarks
are far from chemical equilibrium throughout the expansion. Thermal production
of light quarks (u, d and s) is nearly independent of species. Heavy quark (c
and b) production is quite independent of the transition temperature and could
serve as a very good probe of the initial temperature. Thermal quark production
measurements could also be used to determine the gluon damping rate, or
equivalently the magnetic mass.

from diagrammatic expansions is of interest in many branches of physics. One
method for deriving such equations is the classification-of-diagrams technique
of Taylor. However, as we shall explain in this paper, there are certain points
of Taylor's method which require clarification. Firstly, it is not clear
whether Taylor's original method is equivalent to the simpler
classification-of-diagrams scheme used by Thomas, Rinat, Afnan and Blankleider
(TRAB). Secondly, when the Taylor method is applied to certain problems in a
time-dependent perturbation theory it leads to the over-counting of some
diagrams. This paper first restates Taylor's method, in the process uncovering
reasons why certain diagrams might be double-counted in the Taylor method. It
then explores how far Taylor's method is equivalent to the simpler TRAB method.
Finally, it examines precisely why the double-counting occurs in Taylor's
method, and derives corrections which compensate for this double-counting.

equations of motion are solved numerically within a finite oscillator basis for
the first time adopting short-range repulsive and long-range attractive
two-body forces. We find in all cases that the formation of long- and
short-range correlations and their mixing is related to the long- and
short-range part of the nucleon-nucleon interaction which dominate the
resummation of loop or ladder diagrams, respectively. However, the proper
description of relaxation or damping phenomena is found to require both types
of diagrams as well as the mixed terms simultaneously.
