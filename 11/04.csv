splittings are insensitive to this variable though there are a slight trends
with increasing quark mass. For an appropriate choice of UV cut-off

Moreover, as has been recently pointed out, for moderate values of $\tan\beta$,
in order to achieve gauge and bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification, the top
quark mass must be within $10 \%$ of its fixed point value. In this work we
show that the convergence of the top quark mass to its fixed point value has
relevant consequences for the (assumed) universal soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters at the grand unification scale. In particular, we show that the low
energy parameters do not depend on $A_0$ and $B_0$ but on the combination
$\delta = B_0 - A_0/2$. Hence, there is a reduction in the number of
independent parameters. Most interesting, the radiative $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$
breaking condition implies strong correlations between the supersymmetric mass
parameter $\mu$ and the supersymmetry breaking parameters $\delta$ and
$M_{1/2}$ or $m_0$. These correlations, which become stronger for $\tan\beta <
2$, may have some fundamental origin, which would imply the need of a
reformulation of the naive fine tuning criteria.

of symmetry generators using Castellani's method. We then discuss the
light-cone gauge fixed theory. In particular, we clarify the difference between
Hamiltonian approaches based on different choices of time, $\xi^0$ and $\xi^+$.
Our main result is the construction of SL(2,R) symmetry generators in both
cases. ( Lectures presented at the Danube Workshop '93,

"hep-th/9311033",,"Djordje \v{S}ija\v{c}ki","QCD Originated Dynamical Symmetry for Hadrons","13 pages, Plain Tex",,,,"hep-th",,"  We extend previous work on the IR regime approximation of QCD in which the
dominant contribution comes from a dressed two-gluon effective metric-like
field $G_{\mu\nu} = g_{ab} B^{a}_{\mu} B^{b}_{\nu}$ ($g_{ab}$ a color SU(3)
metric). The ensuring effective theory is represented by a
pseudo-diffeomorphisms gauge theory. The second -quantized $G_{\mu\nu}$ field,
together with the Lorentz generators close on the $\bar{SL}(4,R)$ algebra. This
algebra represents a spectrum generating algebra for the set of hadron states
of a given flavor - hadronic ""manifields"" transforming w.r.t. $\bar{SL}(4,R)$
(infinite-dimensional) unitary irreducible representations. The equations of
motion for the effective pseudo-gravity are derived from a quadratic action
describing Riemannian pseudo-gravity in the presence of shear ($\bar{SL}(4,R)$
covariant) hadronic matter currents. These equations yield $p^{-4}$
propagators, i.e. a linearly rising confining potential $H(r) \sim r$, as well
as linear $J \sim m^{2}$ Regge trajectories. The $\bar{SL}(4,R)$ symmetry based
dynamical theory for the QCD IR region is applied to hadron resonances. All
presently known meson and baryon resonances are successfully accommodated and
various missing states predicted. (Lectures presented at the Danube Workshop

  of 8B","(LaTeX, 23 pages)",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.49.886",,"nucl-th",,"  E2 properties of A=6--10 nuclei, including those of nuclei far from
stability, are studied by a $(0+2)\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculation which
includes E2 core-polarization effects explicitly. The quadrupole moments and
the E2 transition strengths in A=6--10 nuclei are described quite well by the
present calculation. This result indicates that the relatively large value of
the quadrupole moment of $^8$B can be understood without introducing the
proton-halo in $^8$B. An interesting effect of the $2\hbar\omega$
core-polarization is found for effective charges used in the $0\hbar\omega$
shell model; although isoscalar effective-charges are almost constant as a
function of nucleus, appreciable variations are needed for isovector
effective-charges which play important roles in nuclei with high
isospin-values.
