maximally symmetric phase space the only applicable Hamiltonians are
essentially harmonic oscillators, while for non-homogeneous phase spaces the
possibilities are more numerous but ambiguities in the path integrals occur. In
the latter case we give general formulas for the Darboux Hamiltonians, as well
as the Hamiltonians which result naturally from a generalized coherent state
formulation of the quantum theory which shows that again the Hamiltonians so
obtained are just generalized versions of harmonic oscillators. Our analysis
and results describe the quantum geometry of some two dimensional systems.

Vlasov-Nordheim equation and study the sensitive dependence of this highly
non-linear equation on the initial conditions. We find that, when nuclear
matter is inside the spinodal region, initially small differences between
similar trajectories grow exponentially and produce strongly divergent paths
resulting in a chaotic evolution. We focus on the fact that chaos spontaneously
arises without putting any additional noise. We calculate the largest Lyapunov
exponent for various initial densities. This analysis is performed for nuclear
matter in two dimensions. It is argued that the mean field chaoticity can cause
nuclear multifragmentation observed in intermediate energy heavy-ion reactions.

by $A(D_{\vec x})\bd GF=0,\, B(D_{\vec x})(\bd FF - \bd GG)=0$ where both $A$
and $B$ are even polynomials in their variables, then there can be a continuum
of vacua, parametrized by a vacuum angle $\phi$. The ramifications of this
freedom on the construction of one- and two-soliton solutions are discussed. We
find, e.g., that once the angle $\phi$ is fixed and we choose $u=\arctan G/F$
as the physical quantity, then there are four different solitons (or kinks)
connecting the vacuum angles $\pm\phi$, $\pm\phi\pm\Pi2$ (defined modulo
$\pi$). The most interesting result is the existence of a ``ghost'' soliton; it
goes over to the vacuum in isolation, but interacts with ``normal'' solitons by
giving them a finite phase shift.
