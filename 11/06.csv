non-linear clustering in a flat Universe, dominated by Cold + Hot Dark Matter
(CHDM) with 60% of CDM, 30% of HDM and 10% of baryons; a simulation box of 100
Mpc a side ($h=0.5$) is used. We analyze two CHDM simulations with $b =1.5$
(COBE normalization). We also compare them with CDM simulations with $b=1.5$
and $b=1$. We evaluate high-order correlation functions and the
void-probability-function (VPF). Correlation functions are obtained both from
counts in cells and counts of neighbors. The analysis is made for DM particles
and for galaxies, identified as massive halos in the evolved density field. We
also check the effects of dynamical evolution and redshift space distortions.
We find that clustering of DM particles exhibits deviations from the
hierarchical scaling, which decrease somewhat in redshift space. Galaxies
follow hierarchical scaling far more closely, with coefficients S_3=2.5 and
S_4=7.5, in general agreement with observational results, just marginally
affected by redshift distortions and on the choices for the initial spectra.
The hierarchical scaling of galaxy clustering is confirmed by the VPF analysis
and in all the cases considered a good agreement with observational results is
obtained.

superconductors are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to calculations carried
out with the help of computers applied to models of strongly correlated
electrons proposed to describe the two dimensional ${\rm Cu O_2}$ planes. The
review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one and
three band Hubbard models, and the ${\rm t-J}$ model are discussed, and their
behavior compared against experiments when available. Among the conclusions of
the review, we found that some experimentally observed unusual properties of
the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In
particular abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical
conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$, the new states observed in the gap in
photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping,
and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be
explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of
superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the
recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a $\dx2y2$
superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results
favor this scenario over others....(continues).

is shown how they allow the general solution of the problem in terms of simple
quadratures. Then we concentrate on the general stationary problem providing
the explicit solving formulas for the metric and the explicit support
conditions for the energy momentum tensor. The chosen gauge allows, due to its
physical nature, to exploit the weak energy condition and in this connection it
is proved that for an open universe conical at space infinity the weak energy
condition and the absence of closed time like curves (CTC) at space infinity
imply the total absence of CTC. It is pointed out how the approach can be used
to examine cosmological solution in 2+1 dimensions.

brief review of Gluodynamics at finite temperature, the nature of the $Z_N$
symmetry in this system is described and its relationship to confinement is
discussed. $Z_N$ domain walls and bubbles are then described as is their
relationship to the confining--deconfining phase transition. The effect of
Fermions is then considered and the presence of metastable extrema of the
Effective Potential for the Polyakov--Wilson Line is described. It is then
argued that these metastable extrema do not correspond to physically realizable
metastable states.

the meson propagator is driven by its coupling to particle-hole pairs and
nucleon-antinucleon ($N\bar{N}$) excitations. We report a reduction in the
$\omega$-meson mass of about 170~MeV at nuclear-matter saturation density. This
reduction arises from a competition between the density-dependent
(particle-hole) dressing of the propagator and vacuum polarization ($N\bar{N}$
pairs). While density-dependent effects lead to an increase in the mass
proportional to the classical plasma frequency, vacuum polarization leads to an
even larger reduction caused by the reduced effective nucleon mass in the
medium.
