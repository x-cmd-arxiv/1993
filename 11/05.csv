star forming regions along the evolutionary track of a collapsing cloud toward
a young stellar object. We have studied a sample of seven small dark clouds
(Bok globules) and eight Herbig Ae/Be stars in the J=1->0 transition of
HCO$^{+}$, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HCN and H$^{13}$CN. The choice of these molecules
is determined by the simple chemistry and the predicted high abundance of the
reactants leading to their formation. The isotopically substituted species
(isotopomers), H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and H$^{13}$CN, were observed in order to
determine, whenever possible, the optical thickness of the main species. The
most abundant isotopomers were found in almost all the sources (detection rate
70-90\%). Those sources which exhibited the strongest signals were also
searched for the $^{13}$C isotopomers. H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ was found in one dark
cloud and around three Herbig Ae/Be stars, while H$^{13}$CN around only one
star. The column densities for each species and the physical conditions of the
objects were derived whenever the observational data allowed it.

show excellent correspondence for both the amplitude and spectrum of radiation.
We also find good agreement with a linearized analytic model for radiation
backreaction, demonstrating that damping due to the lowest n=2 harmonic is
effective in strongly suppressing higher harmonics. This work establishes the
validity of the Kalb-Ramond action in describing low-energy global string
dynamics, along with the associated self-field renormalization of the equations
of motion. We also describe the different nature of massive radiation from high
curvature regions and the collapse and annihilation of a circular loop. As an
application in axion models, we discuss the relative loop and long string
radiation contribution to a cosmological bound on the axion mass. A parallel
linearized formalism for gravitational radiation is also provided.
