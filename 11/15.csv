dwarf galaxies, as deduced by the modified dynamics (MOND) from the observed
velocity dispersions, are systematically smaller than the observed masses, by a
factor of ten or more. We show here that the MOND mass estimator used by Lo et
al. is smaller than the proper expression, by a factor of about twenty. We
derive the proper mass estimator as an exact virial-like relation between the
3-D rms velocity, Vs, and the total mass, M, of an arbitrary, self-gravitating
system, made of light constituents, that is everywhere in the
very-low-acceleration regime of MOND. This reads M=(9/4)Vs^2/G a0. (For a
system that is not stationary, Vs involves also an average over time.) We
further generalize this relation to cases with constituent masses that are not
small compared with that of the whole system. We discuss various applications
of the M-V relation. With the correct estimator the predictions of MOND are, by
and large, in good agreement with the total observed masses (the observed gas
mass plus a stellar mass corresponding to an M/L of order one solar unit).

regime occurs at $T 700K$ or $T \sim 200K$. The predicted correlation length is
of order 6 lattice constants at $T=200K$. Experimental data related to the

question of whether the presence of explicit CP violation in the Yukawa sector

the soft terms, which could lead to observable effects. A clear pattern appears
in the structure of phases in the soft sector. In particular, the inclusion of
intergenerational mixing induces large phases in the flavour mixing entries of
the trilinear soft breaking terms, whereas the diagonal entries remain real. A
mechanism is proposed for generating through chargino exchange a contribution
to the neutron electric dipole moment which can be a few orders of magnitude
larger that that of the Standard Model, although still out of reach of
experimental tests. We comment on the possible relevance of these phases for
baryogenesis at the weak scale in minimal supersymetric scenarios, recently

developing a cohomology theory for Hausdorff gaps. The cohomology theory is
introduced with enough generality to be applicable to other questions in set
theory. For gaps, this leads to a natural equivalence notion about which we
answer questions by constructing many simultaneous gaps.
  The first result is proved by constructing countably many gaps such that the
union of any combination corresponding to a subset of $\omega$ is again a gap.
This is done in ZFC. New combinatorial hypotheses related to club ($\clubsuit$)
are introduced to prove the second result which increases the number of gaps to
$\aleph_1$. The presentation of these results does not depend on the
development of the cohomology theory.
  Additionally, the notion of an incollapsible gap is introduced and the
existence of such a gap is shown to be independent of ZFC.

effects of such hidden rotation symmetry on $D_4\dot{+} T^2$ mode interactions
are studied by analyzing when a $D_4\dot{+} T^2$ symmetric normal form
$\tilde{F}$ can be extended to a vector field ${\rm \cal F}$ with Euclidean
symmetry. The fundamental case of binary mode interactions between two
irreducible representations of $D_4\dot{+} T^2$ is treated in detail. Necessary
and sufficient conditions are given that permit $\tilde{F}$ to be extended when
the Euclidean group ${\rm \cal E}(2)$ acts irreducibly. When the Euclidean
action is reducible, the rotations do not impose any constraints on the normal
form of the binary mode interaction. In applications, this dependence on the
representation of ${\rm \cal E}(2)$ implies that the effects of hidden
rotations are not present if the critical eigenvalues are imaginary.
Generalization of these results to more complicated mode interactions is
discussed.
