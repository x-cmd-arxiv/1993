from a ``stiff source,'' such as a self-ordering cosmic field that forms in a

Although the linear response of the normal matter to the source depends on the
details of the source dynamics, we show that the higher-order non-linear
perturbative equations reduce to a form identical to those of source-free
Newtonian gravity in the small wavelength limit. Consequently, the resulting
$n$-point correlation functions and their spectral counterparts will have a
hierarchical contribution arising from this gravitational evolution (as in the
source-free case) in addition to that possibly coming from non-Gaussian initial
conditions. We apply this formalism to the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model at
large $N$ and find that observable differences from the case of initially
Gaussian perturbations and Newtonian gravity in the bispectrum and higher-order

the first few coefficients in the dimensional expansion for $\gamma_{2n}$, the
renormalized $2n$-point Green's function at zero momentum, for $n\!=\!2$, 3, 4,

function of the space-time dimension $D$, $\gamma_{2n}$ appears to rise
monotonically with increasing $D$ and we conjecture that it becomes infinite at
