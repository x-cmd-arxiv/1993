identified by X-ray diffraction as mostly $x=1$ material. The samples were
subjected to various heat treatments, including quenching and slow cooling from
400K. The dramatic increase in the transmission of the quenched samples, and
the relaxation towards the transmission observed in slow cooled samples
provides direct evidence for the existence of a metastable insulating phase.
Slow cooling results in a phase transition between two electrically conducting
phases.

the scaling of the string tension and massgap in a variant of this action on
dynamically triangulated random surfaces and compare the results with the
gaussian plus extrinsic curvature actions that have been used previously.

"math/9311213","Mikhail Lyubich","Mikhail Lyubich","Teichm\""uller space of Fibonacci maps",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1993/12","math.DS",,"  According to Sullivan, a space ${\cal E}$ of unimodal maps with the same
combinatorics (modulo smooth conjugacy) should be treated as an
infinitely-dimensional Teichm\""{u}ller space. This is a basic idea in
Sullivan's approach to the Renormalization Conjecture. One of its principle
ingredients is to supply ${\cal E}$ with the Teichm\""{u}ller metric. To have
such a metric one has to know, first of all, that all maps of ${\cal E}$ are
quasi-symmetrically conjugate. This was proved [Ji] and [JS] for some classes
of non-renormalizable maps (when the critical point is not too recurrent). Here
we consider a space of non-renormalizable unimodal maps with in a sense fastest
possible recurrence of the critical point (called Fibonacci). Our goal is to
supply this space with the Teichm\""{u}ller metric.
