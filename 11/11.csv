selection of these bursts (duplicated in this work in Sample 1) involved a peak
countrate (in counts s-1) uncorrected for aspect. We assert that the peak flux
of a burst is physically more meaningful than peak count-rate. Using, as
limits, the corresponding peak fluxes (in photons cm-2 s-1) for the bursts in
the QL sample, we find an additional 24 bursts, which we include in a new
sample (Sample 2). We find that the significance of anisotropy in Sample 2 is
much less than that of Sample 1, which does not support QL's interpretation of
the anisotropies as being due to a galactic population. To make meaningful
statistical statements regarding isotropy, burst samples must have peak fluxes
above a minimum flux, set by the requirement that a burst be detectable from
any direction (above the horizon) with respect to GRO, at any detection
threshold at which a burst was observed in that sample. We find that a sample
of such bursts has a marginal (2.6 sigma) deviation from isotropy, which we
consider insufficient to justify the claim that GRBs are galactic in origin.

were formed along the universal expansion, the paper shows that the force of
nature form a chain from the world of the prequarks to the galaxies. It is
shown that matter has a generalized structured state characterized by some
degree of order and by a Lennard-Jones effective potential. The existence of
this state at the level of quarks and galaxies suggests that nature has two
more fundamental forces, a superstrong interaction which acts among prequarks
and quarks, and a superweak interaction which acts among galaxies and clusters
of galaxies. Quark confinement is explained from first principles. The energies
of all hadrons, including all known resonances, are calculated in a simple
manner. The error, for each particle, between calculated and experimental
values, is below 5%, in general, and goes as low as 0.5% for some levels. The
energies of all the other hadrons(which have not been found experimentally) are
predicted. The energies of the excited states of quarks are calculated.
According to the work the Higgs boson does not exist, since the masses of
hadrons and quarks are generated by an effective potential which comes about
from the combination of the strong and superstrong interactions.
