  to be published February 1994 JRASC, report# cnoc-1","J.Roy.Astron.Soc.Canada 88 (1994) 39",,,"astro-ph",,"  To test whether clusters have rising mass to light ratios at large radii and
to estimate the amplitude of the density fluctuation spectrum on the scale of
10\hmpc\ the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC) cluster
collaboration is obtaining Multi-Object Spectrograph velocities and two colour
photometry for a sample of $\simeq$1000 cluster galaxies and $\simeq$2000 field
galaxies in a 5\hmpc\ neighborhood of high X-ray luminosity clusters at
$z\simeq 0.3$. X-ray selection of the cluster sample picks out objects on the
basis of the depth of their potential well depth, and is insensitive to both
projection effects and galaxy biases. The galaxy dataset, with selection
controlled using automated photometry, automated mask design, spectral
selection modeling, and accurate velocities, will be the best available at any
redshift for our tests. Measuring mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at large radii
requires a statistical removal of field galaxies projected into the redshift
space of the cluster. This can be done relatively accurately for moderate
redshift clusters, using the large number of foreground and background
galaxies. The CNOC sample also provides a sensitive test of the density
fluctuation spectrum on cluster scales. The 30 or so redshifts available in
each of three clusters gives an average velocity dispersion of about 1000 \kms
which indicates that the $\sigma_8$ normalization parameter is in the range of
$0.6\lta \sigma_8\lta 0.9$.

one-dimensional maps with a single maximum of order $z$. In particurlar, the
effect of the maximum-order $z$ on the critical behavior associated with
coupling is investigated by a renormalization method. There exist three fixed
maps of the period-doubling renormalization operator. For a fixed map
associated with the critical behavior at the zero-coupling critical point,
relevant eigenvalues associated with coupling perturbations vary depending on
the order $z$, whereas they are independent of $z$ for the other two fixed
maps. The renormalization results for the zero-coupling case are also confirmed
by a direct numerical method.

of space-time with closed timelike curves. Exact solutions for extended sources
with apparently physically acceptable energy-momentum tensors, have produced
the same exterior space-time structure. Here it is pointed out that in the case
with torsion, closed timelike curves appear only for spin densities so high
that the spin energy density is higher than the net effective energy density.
In models without torsion, the presence of closed time-like curves is related
to a heat flow of unphysical magnitude. This corroborates earlier arguments
against the possibility of closed timelike curves in space-time geometries
generated by physical sources.

hard scattering process with the well controlled size of quark configurations
which dominate the production amplitude. This allows an unambiguous prediction
of color transparency effects in the coherent and incoherent production of
vector mesons on nuclei. We demonstrate how the very mechanism of color
transparency leads to a belated onset of color transparency effects as a
function of $Q^{2}$. We conclude that the $Q^{2}$ dependence of the exclusive
$\rho^{0}$-meson production on nuclei and nucleons observed in the Fermilab
E665 experiment gives a solid evidence for the onset of color transparency. We
propose the scaling relation between the $\rho^{0}$ and the $J/\Psi$
production, which further tests the mechanism of color transparency in
exclusive (virtual) photoproduction.
