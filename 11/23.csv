recently the frozen flow and linear potential approximations, are sometimes
used to simulate nonlinear gravitational instability in the expanding Universe.
We investigate the relative accuracy of these approximations by comparing them
with the exact solution using second order perturbation theory. We evaluate the
density and velocity fields in these approximations to second order, and also
determine the skewness parameter $S_3 = \langle \delta^3 \rangle / \langle
(\delta^{(1)})^2\rangle ^2$ for each of the approximations again in second
order. We find that $S_3 = 4, ~3, ~3.4$ for the Zeldovich approximation, the
frozen flow and the linear potential approximations respectively as compared to
$S_3 = {34/7}$ for the exact solution. Our results show that, of all the
approximations considered, the Zeldovich approximation is the most accurate in
describing the weakly nonlinear effects of gravity. Moreover, the Zeldovich
approximation is much closer to the exact results for matter and velocity
distributions than the other approximations if the slope of the power spectrum
of density perturbations is $-3< n \le -1$.

include amplitudes containing two twisted-sector states. These amplitudes are
shown to satisfy spurious state decoupling. The restriction to only two
external twisted-sector states is due to the absence of an appropriate
dimension-one vertex describing the emission of a single twisted-sector state.
This is analogous to the ``old covariant'' formalism of ordinary superstring
amplitudes in which an appropriate dimension-one vertex for the emission of a
Ramond-sector state is lacking. Examples of tree scattering amplitudes are
calculated in a c=5 model of the spin-4/3 chiral algebra realized in terms of
free bosons on the string world-sheet. The target space of this model is
three-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time and the twisted-sector physical
states are fermions in space-time. Since the critical central charge of the
spin-4/3 fractional superstring theory is 10, this c=5 model is not consistent
at the string loop level.

under a certain homomorphism from the center of U(gl(N)) to the algebra of

affine gl(N) at the critical level k=-N defines a correspondence between higher
Sugawara operators and quantum integrals of the Hamiltonian of the quantum
many-body problem with the potential equal to constant times the Weierstrass
function. This allows one to give a new proof of the Olshanetsky-Perelomov
theorem stating that this Hamiltonian defines a completely integrable quantum
system. We also give a new expression for eigenfunctions of the quantum

between certain representations of gl(N).

sectors with topologically twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric field theories. From
this, we then describe how to recover the complete lattice versions of the
$N=2$ supersymmetric field theories. We discuss a number of simple physical
examples and we describe how to construct a broad class of models. We also give
a brief review of the scattering matrices for the excitations of these models.
