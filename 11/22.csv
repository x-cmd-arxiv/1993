frozen potential approximation (FPA), have been proposed recently for studying
the evolution of a collisionless self-gravitating fluid. In the FFA it is
assumed that the velocity field remains unchanged from its value obtained from
the linear theory whereas in FPA the same approximation is made for the
gravitational potential. In this paper we compare these and the older
Zel'dovich approximation by calculating the evolution of the density in
perturbation theory. In particular we compute the skewness, including the
smoothing effects, and the kurtosis for the FFA, FPA and Zel'dovich
approximation and compare their relative accuracy.

the gap energy of the excitations created in the process and, hence, depends on
the electron number parity. At low temperature the properties of the system are
2e-periodic in the applied gate voltage, turning e-periodic at higher
temperature. We evaluate the tunneling rates and determine the probabilities
for the even and odd state as well as the cross-over condition from the balance
between different processes. Our analysis includes excitations in the leads.
They are essential if the leads are superconducting. The influence of parity
effects on single electron tunneling, Cooper pair tunneling, and the Andreev
reflection in superconducting transistors yields rich structures in the I-V
characteristic, which explains recent experimental findings.

nonperturbative form factor, the shape function, which describes the fall-off
of the spectrum close to the endpoint. The moments of this function are related
to forward scattering matrix elements of local, higher-dimension operators. We
find that nonperturbative effects are dominant over a finite region in the
lepton energy spectrum, the width of which is related to the kinetic energy of
the $b$-quark inside the $B$ meson. Applications of our method to the
extraction of fundamental standard model parameters, among them $V_{ub}$, are
discussed in detail.

place naturally, identifying the inflaton with a right-handed sneutrino with
its mass $M \simeq 10^{13}$GeV, which is consistent with the COBE data and the
Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein solution to the solar neutrino problem. The
