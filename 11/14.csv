Ising model of spin-spin interactions, is the simplest possible model
displaying many ``real world'' features, but it is much more difficult to
analyze qualitatively than the Ising model. After a third of a century of
research, we are still not sure about many of its basic properties. This
mini-review will explore what is known rigorously about the model and it will
attempt to describe some open problems that are possibly within the range of
rigorous mathematical analysis.

quantum state of Hartle and Hawking. We reformulate the no-boundary
wavefunction in the representation of true physical variables and calculate it
in the one-loop approximation. For this purpose a special technique is
developed, which reduces the formalism of complex tunnelling geometries to the
real ones, and also the method of collective variables is applied, separating
the macroscopic collective degrees of freedom from the microscopic modes. The
quantum distribution of Lorentzian universes, defined on the space of such
collective variables, incorporates the probabilty conservation and represents
the partition function of quasi-DeSitter gravitational instantons weighted by
their Euclidean effective action. They represent closed compact manifolds
obtained by the procedure of doubling the Euclidean spacetime which nucleates
the Lorentzian universes. The over-Planckian behaviour of their distribution is
determined by the anomalous scaling of the theory on such instantons, which
serves as a criterion for the high-energy normalizability of the no-boudary
wavefunction and the validity of the semiclassical expansion.

spin-one hadrons along with the Gottfried sum rule. Both sum rules are similar
in the sense that they are phenomenological ones based on a naive parton model.
As the Gottfried sum rule became useful for studying SU(2)$_{flavor}$ breaking
in antiquark distributions, the $b_1$ sum rule could provide important
information on sea-quark tensor polarization.
  2) Pionic contributions to the antiquark distribution $\bar u-\bar d$ and
violation of the Gottfried sum rule are discussed. We find that the
contributions account for about half of the discrepancy found by the New Muon
Collaboration between their result and the sum rule. In order to distinguish
various theoretical explanations, we need independent experimental tests, for
example, by using Drell-Yan processes. As an application of mesonic
calculations, the difference between strange and antistrange quark
distributions in the nucleon is briefly discussed.
