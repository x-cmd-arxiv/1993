provide useful constraints on models of large--scale structure formation. This
article will review some recent three dimensional, multi--fluid simulations of
cluster dynamics and discuss their impact on issues raised from optical and
X-ray observations of clusters. In `bottom--up' formation scenarios (such as
the ubiquitous cold dark matter model), galaxies form before rich clusters;
hence, cluster formation is intimately linked to galaxy formation which, in
turn, is tied to star formation. I will examine two issues which appear
relatively insensitive to galaxy/star formation --- the baryon fraction in
clusters and the connection between X--ray morphology and $\Omega_o$ --- and
end with a topic that is intimately linked to it --- dynamical biases in the
cluster galaxy population.

within nonlocal QED in 4D [Proc. Roy. Soc. London A 223, 468]. Starting from
secondly quantized fermions subject to a nonlocal action with the kernel $[
i\not\partial_x a(x) - m b(x)]$ and gauge covariantly coupled to an external
U(1) gauge field they found that for $a = b$ the induced gauge field action
cannot be made finite irrespectively of the choice of the nonlocality $a$ $(=
b)$. But, the general case $a \neq b$ naturally to be studied admits a finitely
induced gauge field action, as the present Letter demonstrates.

calculate the transition matrix elements in a coherent state basis. In this

particular when the space has the topology of a sphere $S^{2}$ or a torus
$T^{2}$, the spacetimes constructed from these two formulations can be
identified and the classical equivalence between the ADM and the CSG is shown.
Moreover in the $g=1$ case the relations between their phase spaces, and
therefore between their quantizations, are given in almost the same form as
that in the case when the cosmological constant vanishes. There are, however,
some modifications, the most remarkable one of which is that the phase space of
the CSG is in 1 to 2 correspondence with the one of the ADM when the
cosmological constant is negative.

observables, no quasiparticle pole, and anomalous screening of the Coulomb

primary fields in the conformal limit, have interesting and, in some ways,
unexpected properties in the SG model. Some of them continue to have scale-
invariant dynamics even in the presence of the non-conformal cosine
interaction. For instance, it is shown that the Mandelstam operator for the
bosonic representation of the Fermi field does {\it not} develop a mass term in
the SG theory, contrary to what the real Fermi field in the massive Thirring
model is expected to do. It is also shown that in the presence of the
non-conformal interactions, some vertex operators have unique Lorentz spins,
while others do not.

on an asymmetric lattice. This lattice has a spacing $a_0 $ in the longitudinal
direction and a spacing $a_t $ in the transversal direction. The limit
$\frac{a_{0}}{a_{t}} \to 0$ corresponds to correlation functions with small
longitudinal and large transversal coordinates, i.e. large $s$ and small $t$.
On this lattice the longitudinal dynamics is described by the usual
two-dimensional chiral field in finite volume and the transversal dynamics is
emerged through an effective interaction of boundary terms of the longitudinal
dynamics. The effective interaction depends crucially on the spectrum of the
two-dimensional chiral field. Massless exitations produce an effective
2-dimensional action which is different from the action recently proposed by
H.Verlinde and E.Verlinde. Massive exitations give raise to an effective action
located on the contour in the longitudinal plane.

R^n$ showing that all these Fourier transforms are equal up to a constant
multiple outside the coordinate planes in $\Bbb R^n.$
  For $a_1\geq ... \geq a_n\ge0$ and $q>0,$ denote by $\ell_{w,q}^n$ the
$n$-dimensional Lorentz space with the norm $\|(x_1,...,x_n)\| = (a_1
(x_1^{*})^q +...+ a_n (x_n^{*})^q)^{1/q}$, where $(x_1^{*},...,x_n^{*})$ is the
non-increasing permutation of the numbers $|x_1|,...,|x_n|.$ We use the above
mentioned formula and the Fourier transform criterion of isometric
embeddability of Banach spaces into $L_q$ \cite{10} to prove that, for $n\geq
3$ and $q\leq 1,$ the space $\ell_{w,q}^n$ is isometric to a subspace of $L_q$
if and only if the numbers $a_1,...,a_n$ form an arithmetic progression. For
$q>1,$ all the numbers $a_i$ must be equal so that $\ell_{w,q}^n = \ell_q^n.$
Consequently, the Lorentz function space $L_{w,q}(0,1)$ is isometric to a
subspace of $L_q$ if and only if {\it either} $0<q<\infty$ and the weight $w$
is a constant function (so that $L_{w,q}= L_q$), {\it or} $q\le 1$ and $w(t)$
is a decreasing linear function.
  Finally, we relate our results to the theory of positive definite functions.
