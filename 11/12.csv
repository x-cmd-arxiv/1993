  IAP Meeting ``Cosmic Velocity Field'', Paris, June 1993. LaTeX",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The evolution of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of continuous
density, velocity and velocity derivatives ( deformation tensor) fields in the
theory of cosmological gravitational instability are considered. We show that
in the Newtonian theory the dynamical equations cannot be reduced to the closed
set of Lagrangian equations.
  Since continuous fields from galaxy surveys need sufficiently large smoothing
which exceeds the scale of nonlinearity, one can use the Zel'dovich
approximation to describe the mildly non-linear matter evolution, which allows
the closed set of Lagrangian equations. The closed kinetic equation for the
joint PDF of cosmological continuous fields is derived in this approximation.
  The analytical theory of the cosmological PDFs with arbitrary (including
Gaussian) initial statistics is developed, based on the solution on the kinetic
equaiton. For Gaussian initial fluctuations, the PDFs are parametrized by only
linear {\it rms} fluctuations $\sigma$ on given filtering scale. Density PDF
$P(\rho, t)$ and PDF $M(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3; t)$ of eigenvalues of
the deformation tensor field in the Eulerian space evolve very rapidly in
non-linear regime. On the contrary, velocity PDF $Q(\vec v, t)$ remains
invariant under non-linear evolution. For small $\sigma$ the Edgworth series is
suggested to reconstruct

analysis extends the results into the multistreaming regime using the smoothed
fields of a CDM N-body simulation. We find that the PDF of velocity, both
Lagrangian and Eulerian, remains Gaussian under the laminar Zel'dovich
approximation, and it is almost indistinguishable from Gaussian in the
simulations. The PDF of mass density deviates from a normal distribution early
in the quasilinear regime and it develops a shape remarkably similar to a
lognormal distribution with one parameter, the \rms density fluctuation
$\sigma$. Applying these results to currently available data we find that the
PDFs of the velocity and density fields, as recovered by the \pot\ procedure
from observed velocities assuming $\Omega=1$, or as deduced from a redshift
survey of \iras\ galaxies assuming that galaxies trace mass, are consistent
with Gaussian initial fluctuations.

the disorder at $d=1$, and the presence of a phase transition from a weak to
strong disorder regime for $d>1$. The lengthscale exponent for the critical
point is $\nu=1/2\mid\epsilon\mid$. We give details of the renormalization. We
show that higher moments do not require any new interaction, and hence the
$\beta$ function remains the same for all moments. The method is extended to
multicritical systems involving an $m$ chain interaction. The corresponding
disorder induced phase transition for $d>d_m=1/(m-1)$ has the critical exponent
${\nu}_m=[2d(m-1)-2]^{-1}$. For both the cases, an essential singularity
appears for the lengthscale right at the upper critical dimension $d_m$. We
also discuss the strange behavior of an annealed system with more than two

sets of reality conditions lead to inequivalent quantizations of full general

accordingly and the transformation of the Higgs fields from the weak to the

also demonstrate that the Type III natural flavour-conserving model is valid at

  UI-NTH-9310",,,,"nucl-th",,"  The sensitivity of the deuteron and of $pp$ scattering to the $\pi NN$ and
$\rho NN$ coupling constants is investigated systematically. We find that the
deuteron can be described about equally well with either {\it large $\pi$ and
$\rho$} or {\it small $\pi$ and $\rho$} coupling constants. However, $pp$
scattering clearly {\it requires} the strong $\rho$, but favors the weak $\pi$
(particularly, in $^3P_0$ at low energies). This apparent contradiction between
bound-state and scattering can be resolved by either assuming charge-dependent
$\pi NN$ coupling constants or by adding a heavy pion to the NN model. In both
cases, the neutral-pion coupling constant is small ($g^2_{\pi^0}/4\pi= 13.5$).

2+1 dimensions, which are integrable by the use of the Spectral Transform,
admit localized (in the space) soliton solutions. This article briefly reviews
some of the main results obtained in the last five years thanks to the renewed
interest in soliton theory due to this discovery. The theoretical tools needed
to understand the unexpected richness of behaviour of multidimensional
localized solitons during their mutual scattering are furnished. Analogies and
especially discrepancies with the unidimensional case are stressed.

experimenting new theoretical tools able to handle the specific features of
integrable models in $2+1$ dimensions. The linearized version of the KPI
equation is first considered by solving the initial value problem for different
classes of initial data. Properties of the solutions in different cases are
analyzed in details. The obtained results are used as a guideline for studying
the properties of the solution $u(t,x,y)$ of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I
(KPI) equation with given initial data $u(0,x,y)$ belonging to the Schwartz
space. The spectral theory associated to KPI is studied in the space of the
Fourier transform of the solutions. The variables $p=\{p_1,p_2\}$ of the
Fourier space are shown to be the most convenient spectral variables to use for
spectral data. Spectral data are shown to decay rapidly at large $p$ but to be
discontinuous at $p=0$. Direct and inverse problems are solved with special
attention to the behaviour of all the quantities involved in the neighborhood
of $t=0$ and $p=0$. It is shown in particular that the solution $u(t,x,y)$ has
a time derivative discontinuous at $t=0$ and that at any $t\not=0$ it does not
belong to the Schwartz space no matter how small in norm and rapidly decaying
at large distances the initial data are chosen.
