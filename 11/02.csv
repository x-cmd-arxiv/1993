galaxies with normal galaxies in complete samples (i.e. CfA and IRAS), which
enables us to compare directly the amplitudes and shapes of the correlation
functions. For pair separations $r\gs 2\mpc$, we find that the shape is in
agreement with that of the correlation functions for other galaxies. The
amplitudes ($A$) of $\xiab (r)$ are lower than those of the autocorrelation
functions for the CfA and IRAS samples, with $A_{\rm LSB-CfA}:A_{\rm
CfA-CfA}\approx 0.4$ and $A_{\rm LSB-IRAS}:A_{\rm IRAS-IRAS}\approx 0.6$. These
results suggest that LSB galaxies are imbedded in the same large scale
structure as other galaxies, but are less strongly clustered. This offers the
hope that LSB galaxies may be unbiased tracers of the mass density on large
scales. For $r\ls 2\mpc$, the cross-correlation functions are significantly
lower than that expected from the extrapolation of $\xiab$ on larger scales,
showing that the formation and survival of LSB galaxies may be inhibited by
interaction with neighboring galaxies.
  The model which matches these observations suggests that strong luminosity
segregation in galaxy clustering is not a necessary consequence of biased
galaxy formation, unless the effect of surface brightness is taken in to
account. It is also implies a significant mass density in LSB galaxies.

constrained system, should start by recognizing the improper nature of the
constraints. Then each boundary conditon defines a problem which must be
treated sparately. The model is settled on a compact domain which allows for a
discrete formulation of the dynamics; thus, avoiding the mixing of local with
collective coordinates. For periodic boundary conditions the model turns out to
be a gauge theory whose gauge invariant sector contains only chiral
excitations. For antiperiodoc boundary conditions, the mode is a second-class
theory where the excitations are also chiral. In both cases, the equal-time
algebra of the quantum energy-momentum densities is a Virasoro algebra. The
Poincar\'e symmetry holds for the finite as well as for the infinite domain.

field theory using the recursion relations for string vertices and the
existence of connections in CFT theory space. Indeed, with this data we
construct an antibracket preserving map between the state spaces of two nearby
conformal theories taking the corresponding string field measures $d\mu
e^{2S/\hbar}$ into each other. A geometrical construction of the map is
achieved by introducing a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra on spaces of Riemann
surfaces, together with a map to the BV algebra of string functionals. The
conditions of background independence show that the field independent terms of
the master action arise from vacuum vertices $\V_{g,0}$, and that the overall
$\hbar$-independent normalization of the string field measure involves the
theory space connection. Our result puts on firm ground the widely believed
statement that string theories built from nearby conformal theories are
different states of the same theory.

the $3D$ black string after a correlated limit is taken in the latter model. By
identifying the CFT corresponding to these $\s$-models we compute the exact
expressions for the metric and dilaton fields. All of our models can be mapped
to flat spacetimes with zero antisymmetric tensor and dilaton fields via
duality transformations.

belonging to the same class. The leading-order solutions of the conformal
invariance equations (metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton), as well as the
action of $O(D,D)$ duality transformations on them, are exact, i.e. are not
modified by $\a'$-corrections. This makes a discussion of different space-time
representations of the same string solution (related by $O(D,D|Z)$ duality
subgroup) rather explicit. We show that the $O(D,D)$ duality may connect curved
$2+D$-dimensional backgrounds with solutions having flat metric but, in
general, non-trivial antisymmetric tensor and dilaton. We discuss several
particular examples including the $2+D=4$ - dimensional background that was
recently interpreted in terms of a WZW model.
