scale shorter than that of pulses which compose GRBs to a time scale similar to
a greater envelope that contains these pulses. We also find bursts which
manifest significant asymmetry only on time scales comparable to the duration
of burst, and bursts for which no clear asymmetry on any time scale is present.
The sense of the asymmetry is that bursts and/or component structures rise in a
shorter time than they decay. We also find that our whole sample of bursts
taken together is time- asymmetric, in that there are significantly more bursts
and pulses where the rise is more rapid than the decay, on all time scales

successful reconstruction of observed galaxy density fields from measured
galaxy velocity fields (or vice versa), using the methods of gravitational
instability theory, implies that the observed large-scale structures and
large-scale flows were produced by the action of gravity. This assumption is
false, in that there exist non-gravitational theories that pass the
reconstruction tests and gravitational theories with certain forms of biased
galaxy formation that fail them. Gravitational instability theory predicts
specific correlations between large-scale velocity and mass density fields, but
the same correlations arise in any model where (a) structures in the galaxy
distribution grow from homogeneous initial conditions in a way that satisfies
the continuity equation, and (b) the present-day velocity field is irrotational
and proportional to the time-averaged velocity field. We demonstrate these
assertions using analytical arguments and N-body simulations of gravitational
and non-gravitational models. We also show examples of gravitational and
non-gravitational models that {\it fail} reconstruction tests because galaxy
formation is modulated (``biased'') in a way that violates the continuity
equation. We discuss the relation between the value of $\Omega$ inferred from
velocity-density comparisons and the true cosmological value.

theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These differential algebras
generated by algebras of the form functions $\otimes$ matrix are shown to be
skew tensorproducts of differential forms with a specific matrix algebra. For
that we derive a general formula for differential algebras based on tensor
products of algebras. The result is used to characterize differential algebras
which appear in models with one symmetry breaking scale.

  Preprint No. unassigned",,,,"nucl-th",,"  It is shown that when higher-shell admixtures are included for systems with
two valence particles or holes, there are effects which are quite different
from those for one-valence-nucleon systems. For example, for nuclei with one
valence particle or hole, there is no first-order correction for the magnetic
dipole moment or the Gamow-Teller transition amplitude. However for nuclei with
two valence particles or holes, one can get substantial corrections. The
effects of the tensor and spin-orbit interactions in core renormalization are
emphasized. We find that in 6Li, the spin-orbit interaction causes the
quadrupole moment of the J=1+ ground state to be positive, but the tensor
interaction causes it to be negative. The G-matrices derived from realistic
interactions are employed in these calculations.

involving scalar-isoscalar and pseudoscalar-isovector quark-quark interactions.
Average meson fields are defined by minimizing the effective Euklidean action.
The fermionic part of the action, which contains the full Dirac sea, is
regularized within Schwinger's proper-time scheme. The meson fields are
restricted to the chiral circle and to hedgehog configurations. The only
parameter of the model is the constituent quark mass $M$ which simultaneously
controls the regularization. We evaluate meson and quark fields
self-consistently in dependence on the constituent quark mass. It is shown that
the self-consistent fields do practically not depend on the constituent quark
mass. This allows us to define a properly parameterized reference field which
for physically relevant constituent masses can be used as a good approximation
to the exactly calculated one. The reference field is chosen to have correct
behaviour for small and large radii. To test the agreement between
self-consistent and reference fields we calculate several observables like
nucleon energy, mean square radius, axial-vector constant and delta-nucleon
mass splitting in dependence on the constituent quark mass. The agreement is
found to be very well. Figures available on request.
