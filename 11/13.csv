D49 (1994) 755-762","10.1103/PhysRevD.49.755",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  We evaluate the cross section for electron-positron pair production by a
single high energy photon in the space-time of a static, straight cosmic
string. Energy and momentum conservation precludes this process in empty
Minkowski space. It happens around a cosmic string, in spite of the local
flatness of the metric, as a consequence of the conical structure of space.
Previous results based on a simplified model with scalar fields are here
extended to the realistic QED case. Analytic expressions are found in three
different regimes: near the threshold, at energies much larger than the
electron rest mass M, and at ultrahigh energies, much larger than $M/\delta$,
with $\delta$ the string mass per unit length in Planck units.

factors in upcoming e+ e- experiments, as recently discussed by Atwood and

dipole moment (MDM) form factor of the top quark is gauge dependent, in the
class of renormalizable ($R_{\xi}$) gauges. We explicitly calculate its gauge
dependence, which, due to the massiveness of the top quark, turns out to be
numerically very sizable. We show how to use the S-matrix pinch technique in
order to define gauge independent form factors. The real and imaginary parts of
the gauge independent MDM form factor are calculated and their dependence on
the top quark and Higgs boson masses is discussed. Most noticeably, the
dependence on the Higgs mass turns out to be stronger than that of the cross
section as a whole.

analysis of sphaleron baryon-number violating processes in the standard model
including lepton-mass effects. We find the surprising result that a GUT-scale
matter-asymmetry can survive the $B$ and $L$ violating sphaleron interactions
even though ($B- L$) is conserved and equals zero for all temperatures. We
extend the analysis to cover the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).
As a new result we present the MSSM analysis below the temperature of
electroweak breaking and for $B-L=0$ at all temperatures

the heavy baryon and a free heavy quark. It is argued that the physics of
confinement plays an inessential role in determining semileptonic decay form
factors. The model has a well-defined heavy-quark expansion which has a form
consistent (through order 1/m_Q) with that determined by QCD through the
heavy-quark effective theory. The slope of the Isgur-Wise function is
consistent with the Bjorken sum rule bound. The effect of the Omega_Q^* -

point, we first formulate the CBM in a style that resembles the technique of
loop integrals. Evaluating the self energy and the electromagnetic form factors
of the nucleon in that manner and comparing with the standard analysis where
nonrelativistic perturbation theory is used, allows us to show that our
approach is appropriate and to point out, what approximations are made in the
standard derivation of the model. {}From the form of those loop integrals, we
then show that additional diagrams are needed to preserve electromagnetic gauge
invariance and we assess the corresponding corrections.
