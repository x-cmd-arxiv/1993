structures formed in the universe: gravitational instability. Basic
observational facts are summarized to motivate the standard cosmological
framework underlying most detailed investigations of structure formation. The
observed universe approaches spatial uniformity on scales larger than about
$10^{26}$ cm. On these scales gravitational dynamics is almost linear and
therefore relatively easy to relate to observations of large-scale structure.
On smaller scales cosmic structure is complicated not only by nonlinear
gravitational clustering but also by nonlinear nongravitational gas dynamical
processes. The complexity of these phenomena makes galaxy formation one of the
grand challenge problems of the physical sciences. No fully satisfactory theory
can presently account in detail for the observed cosmic structure. However, as
this article summarizes, significant progress has been made during the last few
years.

mode coupling of density fluctuations. We evaluate the second-order power
spectrum including all four-point contributions. In the weakly nonlinear regime
we find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmological
spectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated by
second order perturbation theory. For a linear spectrum like that of the cold
dark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of the
high $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peak
of the spectrum. Our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regime
with the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution N-body simulations.
  We find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinear
masses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) than
would be estimated using the linear power spectrum. For the cold dark matter
model at $(1+z)=(20,10,5,2)$ the nonlinear mass is about $(180,8,2.5,1.6)$
times (respectively) larger than a linear extrapolation would indicate, if the
condition rms $\delta\rho/\rho =1$ is used to define the nonlinear scale. At
high redshift the Press-Schechter mass distribution significantly
underestimates the abundance of high-mass objects for the cold dark matter
model. Although the quantitative results depend on the definition of the
nonlinear scale, these basic consequences hold for any initial spectrum whose
post-recombination spectral index $n$ decreases sufficiently rapidly with
increasing $k$, a feature which arises quite generally during the transition
from a radiation- to matter-dominated universe.

models at cosmological distances can satisfy the conventional X-ray paucity

renormalization effects a modification of the local commutation relations of
the currents by local Schwinger terms. In $1+1$ dimensions on gets the usual
central extension (Schwinger term does not depend on background gauge field)
whereas in $3+1$ dimensions one gets an anomaly linear in the background
potential. We extend our method to the spatial components of currents. Since
the bose-fermi interaction hamiltonian is of the form $j^k A_k$ (in the
temporal gauge) we get a new renormalization scheme for the interaction. The
idea is to define a field dependent conjugation for the fermi hamiltonian in
the one-particle space such that after the conjugation the hamiltonian can be
quantized just by normal ordering prescription.

Theory, Oxford, September, 1993.) Matrix models provides us with the most
powerful framework in which to analyze D=2 string theory, yet some of its
miraculous features, such as discrete states and $w(\infty)$, remain rather
obscure, because the string degrees of freedom have been removed. Liouville
theory, on the other hand, has all its string degrees of freedom intact, yet is
notoriously difficult to solve. In this paper, we present the second quantized
formulation of Liouville theory in D=2, where discrete states and $w(\infty)$
have a natural, field theoretic interpretation. We generalize the
non-polynomial closed string field theory, first developed by the author and
the Kyoto and MIT groups, to the D=2 case. We find that, in second quantized
field theory language, the rather mysterious features of matrix models have an
intuitively transparent interpretation, similar to standard gauge theory. Latex
