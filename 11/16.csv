genus 9 and 10. The surfaces of degree at most 9 are described through
classical work dating from the last century up to recent years, while surfaces
of degree 10 and other sectional genera are studied elsewhere.
  We use relations between multisecants, linear systems, syzygies and linkage
to describe the geometry of each surface. We want in fact to stress the
importance of multisecants and syzygies for the study of these surfaces.
Adjunction, which provided efficient arguments for the classification of
surfaces of smaller degrees, here appears to be less effective and will play
almost no role in the proofs.
  We show that there are 8 different families of smooth surfaces of degree 10
and sectional genus 9 and 10. The families are determined by numerical data
such as the sectional genus, the Euler characteristic, the number of 6-secants
to the surface and the number of 5-secants to the surface which meet a general
plane. For each type we describe the linear system giving the embedding in P^4,
the resolution of the ideal, the geometry of the surface in terms of curves on
the surface and hypersurfaces containing the surface, and the liaison class; in
particular we find minimal elements in the even liaison class. Each type
corresponds to an irreducible, unirational component of the Hilbert scheme, and
the dimension is computed.

most probable systematic errors within the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy
Catalogue (EDSGC) which could affect the angular correlation function. The
distribution of extinction within the EDSGC area was obtained using the Stark
{\it et al.} HI map and the IRAS $100\mu\rm{m}$ flux map. We find that the
amplitude of the whole EDSGC correlation function varies by less than ${\rm
\delta w}=0.003$ for reddening ratios $\rm{R_V}$ in the range
$3.25\rightarrow6$. This corresponds to a range in average extinction of ${\rm
A_B}=0.12\rightarrow0.24$. Simulations were carried out to assess the
contribution to the correlation function from correlated and uncorrelated plate
magnitude errors. The only simulation that affected the large--scale power seen
in \w was for correlated plate errors with a systematic plate--to--plate offset
of ${\rm \Delta m} =0.02$. This represented an overall $0.4$ magnitude
difference between the ends of the EDSGC which was inconsistent with checks
carried out with external photometry. All other simulations had an
insignificant effect on the large--scale form of the correlation function.
These tests suggest that the large--scale power seen in the EDSGC correlation
function is due to intrinsic clustering and is not an artifact of the
construction or location of the catalogue.

compute the Hawking radiation in these spacetimes. We find that the flux from

important technical trick is to use an extension of the usual junction
condition formalism to probe the full Riemann tensor associated with a thin
shell of matter. Implications with regard to Hawking's chronology protection
conjecture are discussed. Indeed, any attempt to transform a single isolated
wormhole into a time machine results in large vacuum polarization effects
sufficient to disrupt the internal structure of the wormhole before the onset
of Planck scale physics, and before the onset of time travel. On the other
hand, it is possible to set up a putative time machine built out of two or more
wormholes, each of which taken in isolation is not itself a time machine. Such
``Roman configurations'' are much more subtle to analyse. For some particularly
bizarre configurations (not traversable by humans) the vacuum polarization
effects can be arranged to be arbitrarily small at the onset of Planck scale
physics. This indicates that the disruption scale has been pushed down into the
Planck slop. Ultimately, for these configurations, questions regarding the
truth or falsity of Hawking's chronology protection can only be addressed by
entering the uncharted wastelands of full fledged quantum gravity.

the four dimensional free fermionic formulation. We find that the supersymmetry
constraints in the observable and hidden sectors eliminate all large
contributions to $m_u$ and $m_d$ and force them to be much smaller than the
other quark masses. The requirement for an acceptable Higgs doublet spectrum
results in $m_u<<m_d$. In these models a realistic $m_d$ can always be obtained
whereas $m_u$ is at most $10^{-5}~MeV$. For particular choices of flat
directions or vacua $m_u$ can be as small as $10^{-7}~MeV$ but cannot vanish.

three main points to be made about the present status of QCD: $\bullet$ QCD is
right, and we can do many beautiful things with it. $\bullet$ There are several
important concrete problems that lie just beyond the edge of our current
understanding. $\bullet$ There are some foundational issues in QCD, and some
recent developments, that may point toward entirely new directions. These
points will, I believe, emerge quite clearly from the following more detailed
discussion. The discussion will be in three parts. I'll first discuss
elementary processes, then more complicated processes, and then finally
foundational issues.

situation there are four mathematically different scenarios which describe

$W\!B_2$ matter is coupled to the $W\!B_2$ gravity of the critical case. We
