for consistency, and allows a simple frequentist interpretation of the
resulting significance levels. As an example of an application, this formalism
is used to place constraints on bulk flows of galaxies using the results of the
microwave background anisotropy experiments COBE and SP91, and a few
simplifying approximations about the experimental window functions. It is found
that if taken at face value, with the quoted errors, the recent detection by
Lauer and Postman of a bulk flow of 689 km/s on scales of 150$h^{-1}$Mpc is
inconsistent with SP91 at a 95\% confidence level within the framework of a
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The same consistency test is also used to place
constraints that are completely model-independent, in the sense that they hold
for any power spectrum whatsoever --- the only assumption being that the random
fields are Gaussian. It is shown that the resulting infinite-dimensional
optimization problem reduces to a set of coupled non-linear equations that can
readily be solved numerically. Applying this technique to the above-mentioned
example, we find that the Lauer and Postman result is inconsistent with SP91
even if no assumptions whatsoever are made about the power spectrum.

Conference in Calgary, July 1993: The results from the COBE satellite are in
close agreement with the predictions of the standard hot Big Bang model,
suggesting that the Universe was once hot, dense and isothermal, giving a
background radiation spectrum that is close to a perfect blackbody. The
spectrum observed by the FIRAS instrument places strong limits on events and
scenarios occurring later than 1 year after the Big Bang. The observation of
intrinsic anisotropy of the microwave background by the DMR instrument provides
a measurement of the magnitude of the gravitational potential fluctuations that
existed at decoupling. These potential perturbations were either produced in an
inflationary epoch, or else they are initial conditions dating from t = 0. The
angular power spectrum of dT is compatible with the inflationary scenario. The
observed amplitude of dT can be used to restrict theories of the fundamental
structure of matter on micro-physical scales and at energies higher than that
of the most energetic cosmic rays. The DIRBE instrument will provide greatly
improved data on extragalactic IR backgrounds after the strong foreground
emission is subtracted.

shown that stretched exponential tails are possible. An intuitive understanding

constructed, appropriate for studying transport by propagating isolated
vortices. It is found that a perturbed vortex will trap fluid parcels for

instabilities and the transition to spatiotemporal chaos (weak turbulence) in
parametric surface waves. The stability of a periodic standing wave state above
onset is studied against Eckhaus, zig-zag and transverse amplitude modulations
(TAM) as a function of the control parameter $\varepsilon$ and the detuning. A
mechanism leading to a finite threshold for the TAM instability is identified.
Numerical solutions of the model are in agreement with the stability diagram,
and also reveal the existence of a transition to spatiotemporal chaotic states
at a finite $\varepsilon$. Power spectra of temporal fluctuations in the
chaotic state are broadband, decaying as a power law of the frequency
$\omega^{-z}$ with $z \approx 4.0$.
