values of 0.3 $\leq$ log(F$_{25}$/F$_{12}$) $\leq$ 0.5. 78 radio sources were
detected, and of all the objects, 72\% had at least one associated radio
source. Most of the radio sources had diameters of $<$ 3\arcsec, which was the
limit to the angular resolving power of the survey. Those with larger values of
Y had significantly larger values of peak radio, integrated radio, and
100$\mu$m flux densities than those with smaller Y. Also, they generally had
associated masers, and thus were most likely young compact HII regions
containing star forming regions. Those with smaller Y tended not to have
associated maser activity and are probably older HII regions, or stars with
high IR and ionizing radiation, such as T-Tauri type stars. However, all 2298
objects appear to have a strong galactic concentration. Some comparison is made
with the selection of 1717 objects identified by Wood \& Churchwell as HII
regions, but their selection criteria were somewhat different, and they
actually form a subset of ours.

brightness (LSB) disk galaxies are presented. In general, LSB galaxies are
found to be metal poor ($Z < {1 \over 3} Z\solar$). Indeed, some LSB galaxies
rival the lowest abundance extragalactic objects known. These low metallicities
indicate that LSB galaxies evolve slowly, forming relatively few stars over a
Hubble time.
  The low metallicities of LSB galaxies occur even though many are comparable
in size and mass to the prominent spirals which define the Hubble sequence. As
well as being low in surface brightness, these galaxies tend to be isolated.
This suggests that surface mass density and environment are more relevant to
galaxy evolution than gross size.
  Despite the low surface brightness of the disks, massive ($M > 60 M\solar$)
stars are inferred to be present and no abnormality of the IMF is indicated.
Many low excitation \HII regions exist at low metallicity in LSB galaxies, and
the ionization parameter is not tightly correlated with metallicity. However,
there does seem to be a significant envelope of maximum ionization at a given
metallicity.

fluctuation in a random density field with Gaussian fluctuations, and I
rigorously show that it follows the spherical collapse dynamics applied to its
mean initial profile. This result is valid for any cosmological model and is
independent of the shape of the power spectrum. In the early stages of the
dynamics the density contrast of the fluctuation is seen to follow with a good
accuracy the form $$\delta=(1-\delta_L/1.5)^{-1.5}-1,$$ where $\delta_L$ is the
linearly extrapolated overdensity. I then investigate the validity domain of
the rare event approximation in terms of the parameter $\nu=\delta_L/\sigma$
giving the initial overdensity scaled by the rms fluctuation at the same mass
scale, and find that it depends critically on the shape of the power spectrum.
When the power law index $n$ is lower than $-1$ the departure from the
spherical collapse is expected to be small, at least in the early stages of the
dynamics, and even for moderate values of $\nu$ ($\vert\nu\vert\ge 2$).
However, for $n\ge -1$ and whatever the value of $\nu$, the dynamics seems to
be dominated by the small--scale fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of
the peak may not be necessarily correlated to its initial overdensity. I
discuss the implications of these results for the nonlinear dynamics and the
formation of astrophysical objects.
