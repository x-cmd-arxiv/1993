(particularly ttbar quarks) by a vector current, in the region around
threshold. This includes bound states as well as the region above threshold, to
the same degree of accuracy; in both cases radiative and nonperturbative
corrections are included. The contribution of this region to the vacuum
polarization (``threshold effects'') is calculated and compared with a
perturbative calculation; the importance of the threshold effects is found
substantially smaller than claimed by some authors. Open fermion-antifermion
production is also discussed.

central extension (by the ``logarithmic'' 2-cocycle) generalizing the Virasoro
algebra. The corresponding extended subalgebra of integral operators generates
the Lie group of classical symbols of all real (or complex) degrees. It turns
out that this group has a natural Poisson-Lie structure whose restriction to
differential operators of an arbitrary integer order coincides with the second
Adler-Gelfand-Dickey structure. Moreover, for any real (or complex) \alpha
there exists a hierarchy of completely integrable equations on the degree
\alpha pseudodifferential symbols, and this hierarchy for \alpha=1 coincides
with the KP one, and for an integer \alpha=n>1$ and purely differential symbol
gives the n-KdV-hierarchy.
