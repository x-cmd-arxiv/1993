represent one of the most stringent 'bottle necks' for scenarios of large scale
structure formation. As a possibility to relax this constraint, it has been
proposed that early reionization can damp CMB fluctuations on small scales due
to photon diffusion in the ionized plasma. As an example, I investigate the
recently proposed scenario with cold dark matter (CDM) and texture seeds.
There, an analysis of CMB anisotropies shows that early reionization is a
crucial ingredient for this scenario. Without damping, the small scale
anisotropies would dominate and exceed observed limits. In this paper I present
analytical and numerical results for the amount of damping due to early
reionization for CMB perturbations induced by a collapsing texture.
Furthermore, the spectral distortion of the CMB due to Compton scattering of
the hotter plasma electrons is calculated. Next I discuss the physical
processes which lead to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for
the degree of ionization, the electron temperature and the evolution of the
ionizing radiation.

propagate in a non--homogeneous flowing fluid. If the fluid is barotropic and
inviscid, and the flow is irrotational (though it may have an arbitrary time

a sound wave can be put in the (3+1)--dimensional form: d'Alembertian psi = 0.
That is partial_mu(sqrt{-g} g^{mu nu} partial_nu psi)/sqrt{-g} = 0. The
acoustic metric --- g_{mu nu}(t,x) --- governing the propagation of sound
depends algebraically on the density, flow velocity, and local speed of sound.

takes place in flat space + time, the fluctuations (sound waves) are governed
by a Lorentzian spacetime geometry.
