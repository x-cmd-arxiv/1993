galaxy Markarian 279 from January to June 1990. The source, which was in a very
bright state, gradually weakened after the first month of monitoring: the
H-Alpha and H-Beta flux decreased by 20% and 35% respectively, and the
continuum under H-Alpha by 30%. The luminosity-weighted radius of the broad
line region (BLR), as derived from the cross-correlation function, is of the
order of 10 light days. This result is very uncertain because the features in
the light curves are very shallow, but it is unlikely that the radius of the
BLR is more than 1 light month. The profile variations of H-Alpha confirm that
the prevailing motions are not radial. The data of the present campaign and
those obtained in previous years, when the source was in a much weaker state,
show that the red asymmetry of the Balmer lines correlates positively with the
broad line flux. This new effect is briefly discussed.

elsewhere. Spectroscopic and photometric data from many observatories were
combined in order to obtain well sampled light curves of the continuum and of
H-Beta. During the campaign the source varied significantly. The light curves
of the optical continuum and of H-Beta are similar to those obtained with the
IUE. The near-IR flux did not vary significantly except for an increase at the
end of the campaign. The optical continuum and the flux of H-Beta lag the UV
continuum by 1 day or less and by 8 days respectively. These results confirm
that the continuum variations are simultaneous or have a very small lag across
the entire UV-optical range, and that the lines of NGC 3783 respond to ionizing
continuum variations with less delay than those of NGC 5548. As in NGC 5548,
the lag of H-Beta is greater than those of the high ionization lines.

that dynamically similar galaxies (e.g., those with comparable Rv^2) exist over
a large range in surface density.
  These LSB galaxies are strikingly blue. The complete lack of correlation
between central surface brightness and color rules out any fading scenario.
Similarly, the oxygen abundances inferred from HII region spectra are
uncorrelated with color so the low metallicities are not the primary cause of
the blue colors. While these are difficult to interpret in the absence of
significant star formation, the most plausible scenario is a stellar population
with a young mean age stemming from late formation and subsequent slow
evolution.
  These properties suggest that LSB disks formed from low initial overdensities
with correspondingly late collapse times.

procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut
predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be
learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning
systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of
a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to
generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and
then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of
learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to
be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate
the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually
caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,
the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that
learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be
restricted to purely declarative logic languages.

"math/9310201",,"Marco Abate and Giorgio Patrizio","Complex Finsler metrics","plain TeX",,,,"math.CV",,"  In this paper we describe an approach to complex Finsler metrics suitable to
deal with global questions, and stressing the similarities between hermitian
and complex Finsler metrics. Let $F$ be a smooth complex Finsler metric on a
complex manifold $M$, and assume that the indicatrices of $F$ are strongly
pseudoconvex -- we shall say that $F$ itself is strongly pseudoconvex.
  The vertical bundle $\cal V$ is the kernel of the differential of the
canonical projection of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $M$. Using $F$, it is
possible to endow $\cal V$ with a hermitian metric; let $D$ be the Chern
connection associated to this metric. It turns out that there is a canonical
way to build starting from $D$ a horizontal bundle $\cal H$, as well as a
bundle isomorphism $\Theta\colon{\cal V}\to\cal H$. Using $\Theta$ we may
transfer both the metric and the connection on $\cal H$; furthermore, there is
a canonical isometric embedding $\chi$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $M$
into $\cal H$.
  Our idea is that the Finsler geometry of $M$ can be studied applying standard
hermitian techniques to $\cal H$ using $\chi$ to transfer back and forth
problems and solutions. To support this claim, in this paper we discuss Bianchi
identities, K\""ahler conditions, the first and second variation formulas,
geodesics and holomorphic curvature. Furthermore, we provide a sound geometric
interpretation to our previous work on the existence of complex geodesic
curves. Finally, we prove that in complex K\""ahler Finsler manifolds with
constant nonpositive holomorphic curvature (and satisfying an additional
symmetry property on the curvature) the complex geodesic curves define a nice
fibration of the manifold, completely analogous to the one described by Lempert
in strongly convex domains.

"math/9311209",,"Mourad E. H. Ismail, Mizan Rahman","Some basic bilateral sums and integrals",,,,"OP-SF 1 Nov 1993","math.CA",,"  By splitting the real line into intervals of unit length a doubly infinite
integral of the form $\Int F(q^x)\,dx,\; 0<q<1$, can clearly be expressed as
$\Integ \Sum F(q^{x+n})\,dx$, provided $F$ satisfies the appropriate
conditions. This simple idea is used to prove Ramanujan's integral analogues of
his \ph{1}{1} sum and give a new proof of Askey and Roy's extention of it.
Integral analogues of the well-poised \ph{2}{2} sum as well as the
very-well-poised \ph{6}{6} sum are also found in a straightforward manner. An
extension to a very-well-poised and balanced \ph{8}{8} series is also given. A
direct proof of a recent q-beta integral of Ismail and Masson is given.
