in a ensemble of rings may survive after ensemble averaging procedure. The
central point is the difference between the preparation stage of the ensemble
and the subsequent measurement stage. The robustness of the effect under finite
temperature and non--zero charging energy of rings is discussed.

and A+A->A on the 1D lattice with synchronous diffusional dynamics
(simultaneous hopping of all particles). Exact connections are found relating
densities and certain correlation properties of these two reactions at all
times. Asymptotic behavior at large times as well as scaling form describing
the regime of low initial density, are derived explicitly.

may be viewed as a $\sigma$-model perturbation of the WZNW theory around the
Witten conformal point. In order for the $\sigma$-model perturbation to be
relevant, the level $k$ of the underlying affine algebra has to be negative. We
prove that in the large $|k|$ limit the perturbed WZNW system with negative $k$
flows to the conformal WZNW model with positive level. The flow appears to be
integrable due to the existence of conserved currents satisfying the Lax
equation. This fact is in a favorable agreement with the integrability of the
WZNW model discovered by Polyakov and Wiegmann within the Bethe ansatz
technique.

representation of gauge theory, we construct well-defined substitutes for
``Lebesgue measure'' on the space A of connections on P and for ``Haar
measure'' on the group Ga of gauge transformations. More precisely, we define
algebras of ``cylinder functions'' on the spaces A, Ga, and A/Ga, and define
generalized measures on these spaces as continuous linear functionals on the
corresponding algebras. Borrowing some ideas from lattice gauge theory, we
characterize generalized measures on A, Ga, and A/Ga in terms of graphs
embedded in M. We use this characterization to construct generalized measures
on A and Ga, respectively. The ``uniform'' generalized measure on A is
invariant under the group of automorphisms of P. It projects down to the
generalized measure on A/Ga considered by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in the case
G = SU(n). The ``generalized Haar measure'' on Ga is right- and left-invariant
as well as Aut(P)-invariant. We show that averaging any generalized measure on
A against generalized Haar measure gives a gauge-invariant generalized measure
on A.
