that case WA affects the lepton spectrum mainly in its endpoint region -- i.e.

thelater to look quite different in $B^-$ than in $B_d$ decays. At present we
are unable to make a truly quantitative prediction; yet a detailled
experimental comparison of the $B^-$ and the $B_d$ lepton spectra will enable
one to determine the size of the relevant matrix elements and to check directly
to what extent the factorization approximation works here. Using universal
analyticity properties of the decay amplitude we analyze WA in the perturbative

the fact that we have a single world sheet, our solutions describe {\bf multi-
ple}(here five) different and independent strings; the world sheet time $\tau$
turns to be a multivalued function of $T$.(This has no analogue in flat space-
time).One string is stable (its proper size tends to a constant for $T\to\infty
$, and its comoving size contracts); the other strings are unstable (their
proper sizes blow up for $T\to\infty$, while their comoving sizes tend to cons-
tants). These solutions (even the stable strings) do not oscillate in time. The
interpretation of these solutions and their dynamics in terms of the sinh-
Gordon model is particularly enlighting.

integration over velocities is not restricted by any boundary conditions;
matrices, which have to be inverted in course of doing Gaussian integrals, do
not contain any derivatives in time, and spinor and isospinor structures of the

the conformal group. The requirement of Schr\""odinger invariance determines the
two-point function in the bulk and reduces the three-point function to a
scaling form of a single variable. Scaling forms are also derived for the
two-point function close to a free surface which can be either space-like or
time-like. These results are reproduced in several exactly solvable statistical
systems, namely the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics, lattice
diffusion, Lifshitz points in the spherical model and critical dynamics of the
spherical model with a non-conserved order parameter. For generic values of
