We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique for this purpose. We
show that the simulation agrees very well with the recent theoretical work on
the shock formation. The most significant conclusion is that shocks in an
inviscid flow are extremely stable. For the first time, our work also removes
the ambiguity in terms of the location and stability of shocks in adiabatic
flows.

collapse are calculated. Exact results are derived for the center-of-mass wave
function collapse caused by random scatterings and applied to a range of

measure the GRW effect are likely to fail, since the effect of naturally
occurring scatterings is of the same form as the GRW effect but generally much
stronger. The same goes for attempts to measure the collapse caused by quantum
gravity as suggested by Hawking and others. The results also indicate that
macroscopic systems tend to be found in states with (Delta-x)(Delta-p) =
hbar/sqrt(2), but microscopic systems in highly tiltedly squeezed states with
(Delta-x)(Delta-p) >> hbar.

momentum in polarized proton-proton collisions. The leading-order (LO) 2 -> 2
subprocesses, g + g -> Q + Q-bar and q+ q-bar -> Q + Q-bar have a large
`analyzing power', as measured by the average spin-spin asymmetry <a-hat_{LL}>,
at large p_T, approaching -100%. The contributions from next-to-leading order
(NLO) 2 -> 3 processes are also discussed and found to be dominated at large
transverse momentum by subprocesses with a large and positive partonic level
spin asymmetry leading to strong cancellations with the LO predictions. The
results suggest that b-quark production might constitute an interesting test of
the spin-dependence of NLO QCD but they also point up the importance of a full
calculation of the complete O(\alpha_S^3) spin-dependent corrections for a
successful extraction of the polarized gluon distribution. Similarities to
gluino pair production are also briefly discussed.

For $K\geq3$ there always exist modules where the Kac determinant factorizes
into a product of more fundamental new determinants. Using our results for
general $K$, we sketch the non-unitarity proof for the $SU(2)$ minimal series;
as expected, the only unitary models are those already known from the coset

prove a coherence theorem for a monoidal category with duals following MacLane
(1963). In the second section we give the definition of a spherical category,
and construct a natural quotient which is also spherical.
  In the third section we define spherical Hopf algebras so that the category
of representations is spherical. Examples of spherical Hopf algebras are
involutory Hopf algebras and ribbon Hopf algebras. Finally we study the natural
quotient in these cases and show it is semisimple.
