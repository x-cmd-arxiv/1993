  Barcelona 4-6. October 1993. Latex",,,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  Dynamical systems at the edge of chaos, which have been considered as models
of self-organization phenomena, are marked by their ability to perform
nontrivial computations. To distinguish them from systems with limited
computing power, we formulate two simplicity criteria for general dynamical
systems, and apply them to unimodal systems on real interval. We say that a
dynamical system is regular, if it yields a regular language when observed
through arbitrary almost disjoint cover. Finite automata are regarded as
dynamical systems on zero-dimensional spaces and their factors yield another
class of simple dynamical systems. These two criteria coincide on subshifts,
since a subshift is regular iff it is a factor of a finite automaton (sofic
systems). A unimodal system on real interval is regular if it has only a finite
number of periodic points, and nonrecursive otherwise. On the other hand each
$S$-unimodal system with finite, periodic or preperiodic kneading sequence is a
factor of a finite automaton. Thus preperiodic $S$-unimodal systems are factors
of finite automata, which are not regular.

composite models of axions. It is argued that it is preferable to use abelian

composite model with no exact $R$ symmetry is studied and it is found that,
unlike common belief, supersymmetry is broken.

on ``quantum symmetry"" which links space-time symmetries in an inexorable way
with internal symmetries. In the course of this attempt, we present several
theorems and in particular derive the Kac-Wakimoto formula which links Jones
inclusion indices with the asymptotics of expectation values in physical

Gibbs-state representation of mapping class group matrices (in a Haag-Kastler

from the Skyrme mean field, where almost all the known and realistic forces
fail to reproduce the observed trend in the empirical data on the charge radii.
The results have been discussed in the perspective of differences in the
ans\""atze of the relativistic and the Skyrme mean-field theories.
