etc. I review the present status of the minimal SO(10) models with special
emphasis on the predictions for proton lifetime and predictions for neutrino
masses for the non-supersymmetric case and discuss some preliminary results for
the supersymmetric case. It was generally believed that minimal SO(10) models
predict wrong mass relations between the charged fermions of the first and
second generations; furthermore, while the smallness of the neutrino masses in
these models arises from the see-saw mechanism, it used to be thought that
detailed predictions for neutrino masses and mixings require further adhoc
assumptions. In this talk, I report some recent work with K.S.Babu, where we
discovered that the minimal SO(10) model, both with and without SUSY, has in it
a built-in mechanism that not only corrects the bad mass relations between the
charged fermions but at the same time allows a complete prediction for the
masses and mixings in the neutrino sector. We define our minimal model as the
one that consists of the smallest set of Higgs multiplets that are needed for
gauge symmetry breaking. Our result is based on the hypothesis that the complex
{\bf 10} of Higgs bosons has only a single coupling to the fermions. This
hypothesis is guaranteed in supersymmetric models and in non-SUSY models that
obey a softly broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry.

A9 (1994) 51-66","10.1142/S0217732394000071",,"hep-th",,"  We show how to formulate $2$-dimensional supersymmetric $N=1,2$ theories,
both massive and conformal, within a manifestly supersymmetric hamiltonian
framework, via the introduction of a (super)-Poisson brackets structure defined
on superfields. In this approach, as distinct from the previously known
superfield hamiltonian formulations, the dynamics is not separated into two
unrelated $2D$ light-cone superspaces, but is recovered by specifying boundary
conditions at a given ``super-time"" coordinate. So the approach proposed
provides a natural generalization of canonical hamiltonian formalism. One of
its interesting features is that the physical and auxiliary fields equations
appear on equal footing as the Hamilton ones.

quark, gluon and ghost anomalous dimensions as well as the anomalous dimensions
of the quark-quark-gluon and ghost-ghost-gluon vertices in the Landau gauge. As
the exponents encode all orders information on the perturbation series of the
corresponding renormalization group functions we find agreement with the known
three loop structure and, moreover, we provide new information at all
subsequent orders.

that the vacuum expectation value of the standard model Higgs is also
responsible for the generation of the Planck mass. In this model the physical
Higgs couples only with gravitational strength to matter. At presently

without Higgs boson and is in agreement with all existing data.At energies
above the Fermi scale new dynamics should occur.

the harmonic oscillator with dissipation is analitically obtained within the
framework of the Lindblad's theory for open quantum systems. We deduce the
density matrix of the damped harmonic oscillator from the solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation for the coherent state representation, obtained from the
master equation for the density operator. The Fokker-Planck equation for the
Wigner distribution function is also solved by using the Wang-Uhlenbeck method
of transforming it into a linearized partial differential equation for the
Wigner function, subject to either the Gaussian type or the $\delta$-function
type of initial conditions. The Wigner functions which we obtain are
two-dimensional Gaussians with different widths.

introduced in \cite{Kal-M}. Our main result states for a separable Banach space
$X$ that the space of compact operators on $X$ is an $M$-ideal in the space of
bounded operators if (and only if) $X$ does not contain a copy of $\ell_{1}$,
has the metric compact approximation property, and has property~$(M)$. The
investigation of special versions of property~$(M)$ leads to results on almost
isometric structure of some classes of Banach spaces. For instance, we give a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for a Banach space to embed almost
isometrically into an $\ell_{p}$-sum of finite-dimensional spaces resp.\ into
$c_{0}$, and for $2<p<\iy$ we prove that a subspace of $L_{p}$ embeds almost
isometrically into $\ell_{p}$ if and only if it does not contain a subspace
isomorphic to $\ell_{2}$.
