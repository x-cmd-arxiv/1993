  SUSB0193",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Nonlinear approximations to problems with mixed boundary conditions are
useful for predicting large-scale streaming velocities from the density field,
or vice-versa. We evaluate the schemes of Bernardeau \cite{bernardeau92},
Gramann \cite{gramann93}, and Nusser \etal \cite{nusser91}, using smoothed
density and velocity fields obtained from $N$-body simulations of a CDM
universe. The approximation of Nusser \etal is overall the most accurate and
robust. For Gaussian smoothing of 1000\kms\ the mean error in the approximated
relative density perturbation, $\delta$, is smaller than 0.06, and the
dispersion is 0.1. The \rms\ error in the estimated velocity is smaller than
60\kms, and the dispersion is 40\kms. For smoothing of 500\kms\ these numbers
increase by about a factor $\sim 2$ for $\delta < 4-5$, but deteriorate at
higher densities. The other approximations are comparable to those of Nusser
\etal for smoothing of 1000\kms, but are much less successful for the smaller
smoothing of 500\kms.

well defined and can be calculated accurately in a Monte Carlo simulation, it
is an ideal quantity to set the scale. In SU(2) pure gauge theory, we use new

for distances $r=0.18$~fm to $r=1.1$~fm. Through $R_0$ we determine the energy
scale in the recently calculated running coupling, which used the recursive
finite size technique to reach large energy scales. Also in this case, the

finite-size effects will effectively raise the ground state energy, masking the
presence of the tachyon for moderate values of $c > 1$. It thus appears likely
that simulations for $c=2,3 \ldots$ on numerically accessible lattices will
fail to even capture the qualitative behavior of the continuum limit.

Kac-Moody algebra. We study the fundamental representation of this class of
examples and prove that an irreducible module is given by the full tensor
algebra over some integrable highest weight module of the underlying Kac-Moody

in $(\gamma,p)$ and $(e,e'p)$ processes are pointed out. For both types of
reactions, the substantial role of two-nucleon emission processes for
transitions to high excitation energies in the residual nucleus is stressed. A
microscopic model for the calculation of the two-body knockout contributions to
the inclusive $(\gamma,N)$ reaction is presented. It is based on an
unfactorized formalism for the calculation of electromagnetically induced
two-nucleon emission cross sections. The model is shown to yield a reasonable
description of the overall behaviour of the $^{12}$C$(\gamma,p)$ and
$^{12}$C$(\gamma,n)$ data at high excitation energies in the residual nucleus.
In the calculations effects from non-resonant and resonant pion exchange
currents are included. Photoabsorption on these currents are predicted to
produce the major contributions to the exclusive $^{16}$O$(\gamma,n_0)^{15}$O
process at photonenergies above the pion threshold. Double differential cross
sections for photon induced $pp$ and $pn$ emission from $^{16}$O are calculated
and compared with the data.
