Teichm\""uller space of the universal hyperbolic lamination. Genus-independent
constructions like the universal period mapping proceed naturally to live on
this completion of the classical Teichm\""uller spaces. We show that
$T(H_\infty)$ carries a natural convergent Weil-Petersson pairing.

\q_1 \qbar_2 \q_3 \qbar_4$ events, i.e.\ that the original colour singlets
$\q_1 \qbar_2$ and $\q_3 \qbar_4$ may be transmuted, for instance, into new
singlets $\q_1 \qbar_4$ and $\q_3 \qbar_2$. The effects on event properties
could be quite large if such a rearrangement would occur instantaneously, so
that gluon emission would be restricted to each of the new singlets separately.
We argue that such a scenario is unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, the $\W^+$
and $\W^-$ usually decay at separate times after the $\W^+\W^-$ production,
which leads to large relative phases for energetic radiation off the two
constituents of a rearranged system, and a corresponding dampening of the QCD
cascades. Secondly, within the perturbative scenario the colour transmutation
appears only in order $\alpha_s^2$ and is colour-suppressed. Colour
reconnection at longer time scales is quite feasible, however, and may affect
the fragmentation phase. If so, the nature of non-perturbative QCD can be
probed in a new way. We formulate several alternative toy models and use these
to estimate the colour reconnection probability as a function of the event
kinematics. Possible consequences for LEP~2 events are illustrated, with
special attention to systematic errors in $\W$ mass determinations.

combines the method of coadjoint orbits with resolutions and chiral vertex
operators to give a construction of the correlation functions of conformal
field theories in terms of geometrically defined objects. Explicit formulae are
given for representations of Virasoro and affine algebras in terms of a local
gauge choice on the line bundle associated with geometric quantization of a
given coadjoint orbit; these formulae define a new set of explicit bosonic
realizations of these algebras. The coadjoint orbit realizations take the form
of dual Verma modules, making it possible to avoid the technical difficulties
associated with the two-sided resolutions which arise from Feigin-Fuchs and
Wakimoto realizations. Formulae are given for screening and intertwining
operators on the coadjoint orbit representations. Chiral vertex operators
between Virasoro modules are constructed, and related directly to Virasoro
algebra generators in certain cases. From the point of view taken in this
thesis, vertex operators have a geometric interpretation as differential
operators taking sections of one line bundle to sections of another. A
suggestion is made that by connecting this description with recent work
deriving field theory actions from coadjoint orbits, a deeper understanding of
the geometry of conformal field theory might be achieved.

constructed from a bare Euclidean action which at a scale much greater than the

finiteness, analyticity, naturalness, and global symmetry. We prove to all
orders in perturbation theory the boundedness, convergence, and universality of
the theory at low energy scales, and thus that the theory is perturbatively
renormalizable in the sense that to a certain precision over a range of such
scales it depends only on a finite number of parameters. We then demonstrate
that the effective theory has a well defined unitary and causal analytic
S--matrix at all energy scales. We also show that redundant terms in the
Lagrangian may be systematically eliminated by field redefinitions without
changing the S--matrix, and discuss the extent to which effective field theory
and analytic S--matrix theory are actually equivalent. All this is achieved by
a systematic exploitation of Wilson's exact renormalization group flow
equation, as used by Polchinski in his original proof of the renormalizability
of conventional $\varphi^4$-theory.

absence of matter fields other than a U(1) gauge field are obtained under a new
gauge choice and recast in the conventional conformal gauge. These solutions
imply that Birkhoff's theorem, originally applied to spherically symmetric 4-d
Einstein gravity, can be applied to all models we consider. Some issues related
to the coupling of massless scalar fields and the quantization are briefly
discussed.

three dimensions. It consists of the addition of the second order gauge
invariant massless pure spin-3 action with the first order
topological(generalized) Chern-Simons spin-3 term corrected with lower spin
auxiliary actions which avoid lower spin ghosts propagation. This second order
intermediate action completes the catalogue of massive spin-3 actions having
topological structure. We also consider its spontaneous break down through the
addition of the inertial spin-3 nontopological Fierz-Pauli mass term. It is
shown that this non gauge invariant pure spin-3 system is the uniform
generalization of linearized massive vector Chern-Simons gravity and propagates
just two spin $3^{\pm}$ excitations having different masses.

  via String Theory","42 pages, TEX",,,,"hep-th",,"  There is a completely natural and intimate relationship between the
diffeomorphism group of the circle and the Teichm\""uller spaces of Riemann
surfaces discovered by us in 1988. Such a relationship had been sought-after by
physicists from conjectures connecting the loop-space approach to string theory
with the path-integral approach. Precisely, the remarkable homogeneous space
Diff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$ (which is one of the two possible quantizable coadjoint
orbits of Diff$(S^1)$), embeds as a complex analytic and K\""ahler submanifold
of the universal Teichm\""uller space. Furthermore, this very homogeneous space,
Diff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$, considered by the previous work as a K\""ahler
submanifold of the universal Teichm\""uller space, allows on it a natural
holomorphic period mapping, $\Pi$, that generalises the classical map
associating to a genus $g$ Riemann surface its period matrix. Utilising the
fact that the group of quasiconformal homeomorphisms of $S^1$ acts
symplectically on the Sobolev space of order $1/2$ on the circle, we (with
Dennis Sullivan) have recently extended $\Pi$ to the entire universal
Teichm\""uller space. All this is related to non-perturbative string theory.
