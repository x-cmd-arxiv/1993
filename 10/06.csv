evolution which drives a secular change of the mean inclination toward the

and forms an inner and an outer shell of precessing orbits. If the remaining
mass is more than $\sim$ 0.02 of the enclosed galaxy mass, rings remain bound
and and are not destroyed by differential precession. The rings precess at a
constant rate for more than a precession period $\tau_p$ finding the
configuration predicted by Sparke in 1986 which warps at larger radii toward
the poles of the potential. We model shear viscosity with a velocity-dependent
drag force and find that nuclear inflow dominates over self--gravity if the

\Lambda^4 [1 + \cos(\phi/f)]$, can naturally give rise to an epoch of inflation
in the early universe (Freese, Frieman, and Olinto 1990). The potential is
naturally flat (as required by microwave background limits on the amplitude of
density fluctuations), without any fine-tuning. Successful inflation can be
achieved if $f \sim m_{pl}$ and $\Lambda \sim m_{GUT}$. Such mass scales arise
in particle physics models with a large gauge group that becomes strongly
interacting at a scale $\sim \Lambda$, {\it e.g.,} as can happen in the hidden
sector of superstring theories. The density fluctuation spectrum can be
non-scale-invariant, with more power on large length scales (Adams, Bond,
Freese, Frieman, and Olinto 1993). This enhanced power on large scales may be
useful to explain the otherwise puzzling large-scale clustering of galaxies and
clusters and their flows. Natural inflation differs from other models with
extra large-scale power in that the contribution of the tensor modes to
microwave background fluctuations is negligible; this difference should serve
as a testable feature of the model.

analytical results for one spatial dimension. We show that a large class of
physical systems can be described by theories with a ``charge density''
$q(\rho)$; this quantity replaces the density on the right hand side of the
Poisson equation for the gravitational potential. We use this formulation to
prove general results about nonlinear wave motions in self-gravitating systems.
We show that in order for stationary waves to exist, the total charge (the
integral of the charge density over the wave profile) must vanish. This
``no-charge'' property for solitary waves is related to the capability of a
system to be stable to gravitational perturbations for arbitrarily long
wavelengths. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the charge density
for the existence of solitary waves and stationary waves. We then apply these
results to study nonlinear waves in Jeans-type theories, Yukawa theories, and a
pseudo-two-dimensional treatment. We study the allowed types of wave behavior
for all of these models. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for

conditions for the existence of a spectral gap, and a dichotomy analogous to

decay of correlations or translation symmetry breaking.

earlier, of the $-P^{(0)}$ spin-$S$ systems with the Potts and the

reveals the geometric aspects of the listed phenomena, and gives a precise
sense to a picture of the ground state in which the spins are grouped into
random clusters of zero total spin. E.g., within such structure the dichotomy
is implied by a topological argument, and the alternatives correspond to
whether, or not, the clusters are of finite mean length.

U_q(sl(N)). All these central elements are however not independent. In this

polynomial relations satisfied by the generators of the centre. Application to

one dimensions have been limited to the analogue of the vacuum generating
functional in field theory. In zero dimensions it was shown that with an
appropriate, $N$-dependent, choice of an optimizing parameter $\l$, which is an
important feature of the method, the sequence of approximants $Z_N$ tends to
$Z$ with an error proportional to ${\rm e}^{-cN}$. In the present paper we
establish the convergence of the linear delta expansion for the connected
vacuum function $W=\ln Z$. We show that with the same choice of $\l$ the
corresponding sequence $W_N$ tends to $W$ with an error proportional to ${\rm
e}^{-c\sqrt N}$. The rate of convergence of the latter sequence is governed by
the positions of the zeros of $Z_N$.

our formalism, and for dimensions smaller but very close to $d_k$ our results
match the $\ee$-expansion. Within the coupling constant subspace of mass and
quartic couplings and for any $d$, we find a gradient flow with two fixed
points determined by a positive-definite metric and a $c$-function which is
monotonically decreasing along the flow.
