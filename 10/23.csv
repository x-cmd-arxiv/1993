cosmological models of structure formation. The galaxies are distributed in a
long, filamentary structure, presumably the result of large amplitude
gravitational instability, yet the local velocity field is cold. In particular,
there are no blueshifted galaxies within 5h^-1 Mpc except those within the
Local Group radius of 1h^-1 Mpc. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate
that such a situation is extremely rare for an observer in Omega=1 CDM models,
but is not uncommon in mixed dark matter (MDM) models that include massive
neutrinos.

of multiscattering systems which show a transition to chaos without losing
hyperbolicity, so that the topological features of the transition are
completely describable by a parameterized family of symbolic dynamics. At a
fixed parameter value the corresponding horseshoe represents the set of orbits
trapped in the scattering region. The bifurcations are a pure boundary effect
and no other bifurcations such as saddle center bifurcations occur in this
transition scenario. Truncated horseshoes actually arise in concrete potential
scattering under suitable conditions. It is shown that a simple scattering
model introduced earlier can realize this scenario in a certain parameter range
(the ""truncated sawshoe"") . For this purpose, we solve the inverse scattering
problem of finding the central potential associated to the sawshoe model.
Furthermore, we review classification schemes for the transition to chaos of
truncated horseshoes originating from symbolic dynamics and formal language
theory and apply them to the truncated double horseshoe and the truncated
sawshoe.

critical slowing down with a temporal power-law divergence. Upon adding a white
