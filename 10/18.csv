the full renormalizable model, we build an effective field theory by
integrating out the heavy scalar. A local effective Lagrangian (up to operators
of dimension six) is obtained by expanding the one-loop effective action in
inverse powers of the heavy mass. This is done by matching some Green functions
calculated with both the full and the effective theories.
  Using this simple example we study the renormalization of effective
Lagrangians in general and discuss how they can be used to bound new physics.
We also discuss the effective Lagrangian after spontaneous symmetry breaking,
and the use of the standard model classical equations of motion to rewrite it
in different forms. The final effective Lagrangian in the physical basis is
well suited to the study of the phenomenology of the model, which we comment on
briefly. Finally, as an example of the use of our effective field theory, we
consider the leptonic flavour-changing decay of the $Z$ boson in the effective

model. In this talk, I point out that in the simplest extension of the standard
model, in which all right-handed fields are singlets, it is quite possible that
a fourth-generation neutrino will be heavier that its charged counterpart. The
latter will then be very long-lived. Three plausible values of the mixing angle
give very different phenomenology; the charged lepton will either decay at the
vertex (albeit into a massless neutrino), away from the vertex but within the
detector, or will pass completely through the detector. In the latter case,
then if the detectors at the LHC and SSC have the ability to determine the
velocity of these particles, they will look just like muons and be missed. In
the extreme case in which the mixing angle is only generated by Planck scale
effects (it can't be zero for cosmological reasons), not only is detection
possible, but collection for further study may be possible. Finally, in an
alternative model in which the fourth generation leptons form an isodoublet,
the possible decay of the charged lepton into $\tau Z$ offers a promising,
nearly background free, method of detection.
