assumption. If so gamma-ray bursts may provide a very good probe for
investigating the topological structure of the Universe. We notice that

regular on the black hole horizon, and diverges at the singularity. A particle
detector response function outside the horizon is also calculated and shown to
be a fermi type distribution. The back-reaction from $\langle T_{\mu\nu}

develops, shielding the singularity. Some speculations about the endpoint of
