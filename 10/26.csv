from previous treatments in the fact that the biased density field coincides
with the background mass--density whenever the latter exceeds a given threshold
value. There is some physical motivation for this scheme and it is in better
accord with intuitive ideas than models based on the Kaiser (1984) analysis of
the clustering of rich clusters. We explain how different classes of object
could be biased in different ways with respect to the underlying density
distribution but still have $b=1$. We also show that if one applies our scheme
consistently a weak dependence of $b$ upon density can be implied. This could
also be the reason why the correlation function of galaxies in groups does not
differ substantially from the correlation function of all galaxies.

expanding at a velocity $v$ and calculate the resulting spectrum of
gravitational radiation in the linearized gravity approximation. Our results
are expressed as simple functions of the mean bubble separation, the bubble
expansion velocity, the latent heat, and the efficiency of converting latent
heat to kinetic energy of the bubble walls. We also estimate the gravity waves
produced by a Kolmogoroff spectrum of turbulence and find that the
characteristic amplitude of gravity waves produced is comparable to that from
bubble collisions. Finally, we apply these results to the electroweak
transition. Using the one-loop effective potential for the minimal electroweak
model, the characteristic amplitude of gravity waves produced is $h\simeq
1.5\times 10^{-27}$ at a characteristic frequency of $4.1\times 10^{-3} \,\rm

that it is BRST invariant, both for the classical and quantum BRST operators.
It is antifield dependent, guaranteeing gauge independence. For topological
field theories, this energy momentum has to be quantum BRST exact. This leads
to conditions at each order in $\hbar$. As an example of this procedure, we
consider topological Yang--Mills theory. We show how the reducible set of
symmetries used in topological Yang--Mills can be recovered by means of trivial
systems and canonical transformations. Self duality of the antighosts is
properly treated by introducing an infinite tower of auxiliary fields. Finally,

vacua for N=2 strings. Continuing this line of string hierarchies, we are led
to search for a universal string theory which includes all the rest as a
special vacuum selection.

is proposed as an example of q-deformed field theory. The corresponding
q-deformed algebra interpolating between bosons and fermions,both in position
and momentum spaces, is analyzed.A possible generalization to a space with an
arbitrary dimension is suggested.

"math/9310213",,"Vladimir Kanovei","IST is more than an algorithm to prove ZFC theorems",,,,"Logic E-prints October 26, 1993","math.LO",,"  There is a sentence in the language of IST, Nelson's internal set theory,
which is not equivalent in IST to a sentence in the ZFC language. Thus the
Reduction algorithm of Nelson, that converts bounded IST formulas with standard
parameters to provably (in IST) equivalent formulas in the ZFC language, cannot
be extended to all formulas of the IST language. Therefore, certain IST
sentences are ""meaningless"" from the point of view of the standard universe.

space isomorphic to a subspace of $X^*$. The paper is devoted to the following
questions: 1. Under what conditions does there exist an isomorphic embedding
$T:Y\to X^*$ such that subspace $T(Y)\subset X^*$ is total? 2. If such
embeddings exist, what are the possible orders of $T(Y)$?
  Here we need to recall some definitions. For a subset $M\subset X^*$ we
denote the set of all limits of weak$^*$ convergent sequences in $M$ by
$M_{(1)}$. Inductively, for ordinal number $\alpha$ we let
$$M_{(\alpha)}=\cup_{\beta<\alpha}(M_{(\beta)})_{(1)}.$$
  The least ordinal $\alpha$ for which $M_{(\alpha)}= M_{(\alpha+1)}$ is called
the {\it order} of $M$.
