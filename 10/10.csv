account the fluctuations of individual driving behavior. The model shows
emergent traffic jams with a self-similar appearance near the throughput
maximum of the traffic. The lifetime distribution of these jams shows a short
scaling regime, which gets considerably longer if one reduces the fluctuations
for driving at maximum speed but leaves the fluctuations for slowing down or
accelerating unchanged. The outflow from a traffic jam self-organizes into this
state of maximum throughput.

traffic gives realistic results. Because of its simplicity, it is easy to
implement the model on supercomputers (vectorizing and parallel), where we have
achieved real time limits of more than 4~million~kilometers (or more than
53~million vehicle sec/sec). The model can be used for applications where both
high simulation speed and individual vehicle resolution are needed. We use the
model for extended statistical analysis to gain insight into traffic phenomena
near capacity, and we discuss that this model is a good candidate for network
routing applications. (Submitted to Transportation Research Board Meeting, Jan.

non--compact $U(1)$ gauge theory on a momentum lattice using the Langevin
equation for generating configurations. In the $\phi^4$-model we have analyzed
the renormalized mass and in the $U(1)$-model we have analyzed the Wilson loop
operator. We used a second order algorithm for solving the Langevin equation,
and we looked for the convergence rate of the method. We studied the stochastic
time needed to generate equilibrium configurations and compared first and
second order schemes for both models.

electrodynamics is exactly solved on a Riemann surface. The partition function
and the generating functional of the correlation functions involving the
fermionic currents are explicitly derived using a method of quantization valid
for any abelian gauge field theory and explained in the recent references [F.
Ferrari, {\it Class. Quantum Grav.} {\bf 10} (1993), 1065], [F. Ferrari, hep-th
9310024]. In this sense, the Schwinger model is one of the few examples of
interacting and nontopological field theories that are possible to quantize on
a Riemann surface. It is also shown here that the Schwinger model is equivalent
to a nonlocal integrable model which represents a generalization of the
Thirring model. Apart from the possible applications in string theory and
integrable models, we hope that this result can be also useful in the study of
quantum field theories in curved space-times.
