gives rise to the pairs of mirror symmetric families of Calabi-Yau complete
intersections in toric Fano varieties with Gorenstein singularities. Our
construction is a generalization of the polar duality proposed by Batyrev for
the case of hypersurfaces.

Oort comet cloud, basing most of our arguments on accepted models for the
formation and spatial distribution of the cloud. We identify three severe
problems with such models: (1) There is no known mechanism for producing bursts
that can explain the observed burst rate and energetics without violating other
observational constraints. (2) The bright source counts cannot be reconciled
with standard models for the phase-space distribution of objects in the Oort
cloud. (3) The observed isotropy of the available burst data is inconsistent
with the expected angular distribution of sources in the Oort cloud. We
therefore assert that Oort cloud models of gamma-ray bursts are extremely
implausible.

numerically calculated and compared with Iwamoto's formula. We find that the
calculated emissivity is smaller than Iwamoto's result by orders of magnitude
when $p_{f}(u)+p_{f}(e)-p_{f}(d(s))$ is comparable with the temperature. We
attribute it to the severe restriction imposed by momentum conservation on the
phase space integral. We obtain an alternate formula for the neutrino
emissivity which is valid when the quarks and electrons are degenerate and
$p_{f}(u)~+~p_{f}(e)~-~p_{f}(d(s))$ is large compared to the temperature.

self-dual Einstein equations (SDE) may be rewritten as evolution equations for
three divergence free vector fields given on a three dimensional surface with a
fixed volume element.
  From this general form of the SDE, it is shown how they may be interpreted as
the field equations for a two dimensional field theory. It is further shown
that these equations imply an infinite number of non-local conserved currents.
  A specific way of writing the vector fields allows an identification of the
full SDE with those of the two dimensional chiral model, with the gauge group
being the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms of a two dimensional
surface. This gives a natural Hamiltonian formulation of the SDE in terms of
that of the chiral model. The conservation laws using the explicit chiral model
form of the equations are also given.

As basic variables connection matrices and antisymmetric area tensors are used
supplemented with appropriate bilinear constraints. In these variables the
action can be made quasipolinomial with $\arcsin$ as the only deviation from
polinomiality. In comparison with analogous formalism in the continuum theory
classification of constraints changes: some of them disappear, the part of I
class constraints including Hamiltonian one become II class (and vice versa,
some new constraints arise and some II class constraints become I class). As a
result, the number of the degrees of freedom coincides with the number of links
in 3-dimensional leaf of foliation. Moreover, in empty space classical dynamics
is trivial: the scale of timelike links become zero and spacelike links are
constant.

connection and bivectors - bilinear in tetrad area tensors subject to
appropriate (bilinear) constraints. In canonical formalism we get theory with
polinomial constraints some of which are II class. On partial resolving the
latter we get another polinomial formulation. Separating self- and antiselfdual
parts of antisymmetric tensors we come to Ashtekar constraints including those
known as ""reality conditions"" which connect self- and antiselfdual sectors of
the theory. These conditions form second class system and cannot be simply
imposed on quantum states (or taken as initial conditions in classical theory).
Rather these should be taken into account in operator sence by forming
corresponding Dirac brackets. As a result, commutators between canonical
variables are no longer polinomial, and even separate treatment of self- and
antiselfdual sectors is impossible.

incorporating the Lorentz and gauge Chern-Simons terms in the definition of the

The circumstances under which it can be recast in form of topologically massive
gravity coupled to a topologically massive gauge theory are pointed out.
Finally, the strong coupling limit of the resulting action is inspected, with
the focus on the roles played by the axion and dilaton fields.
