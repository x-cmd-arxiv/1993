in alloys which exhibit modulated phases. The model is different from the
standard time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau description of the evolution of a
non-conserved order parameter and resembles the Swift-Hohenberg model. The
early-stage growth kinetics is analyzed and compared to the Cahn-Hilliard
theory of continuous ordering. The effects of non-linearities on the growth
kinetics are discussed qualitatively and it is shown that the presence of an
underlying elastic lattice introduces qualitatively new effects. A lattice
Hamiltonian capable of describing these effects and suitable for carrying out
simulations of the growth kinetics is also constructed.

on a segment of the real line. They have different domains of essential
self-adjointness characterized by a suitable set of boundary conditions on the
wave functions. In this paper we show how to recover these extensions by
studying the continuum limit of certain discretized versions of the Laplace
operator on a lattice. Associated to this limiting procedure, there is a
renormalization flow in the finite dimensional parameter space describing the
dicretized operators. This flow is shown to have infinite fixed points,
corresponding to the self-adjoint extensions characterized by scale invariant
boundary conditions. The other extensions are recovered by looking at the other
trajectories of the flow.

information paradox are reconsidered. It is argued that in typical cases
information loss implies energy loss, and thus can be thought of in terms of
coupling to a spectrum of ``fictitious'' remnants. This suggests proposals for
information loss that do not imply planckian energy fluctuations in the low
energy world. However, if consistency of gravity prevents energy
non-conservation, these remnants must then be considered to be real. In either
case, the catastrophe corresponding to infinite pair production remains a
potential problem. Using Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as a paradigm for a
theory of remnants, it is argued that couplings in such a theory may give
finite production despite an infinite spectrum. Evidence for this is found in
analyzing the instanton for Schwinger production; fluctuations from the
infinite number of states lead to a divergent stress tensor, spoiling the
instanton calculation. Therefore naive arguements for infinite production fail.

phase-locked standing-wave structures: rolls, rectangles and cross rolls. At
onset, at most one of the two - rolls or rectangles - is stable. The cross
rolls can arise in a secondary bifurcation and can be stable. Experimentally,
they would appear as a periodic switching between a structure in which the
`zig'-component dominates and one with dominating `zag'-structure. Since there
are two symmetry-related states of this kind one may expect disordered
structures to arise due to the break-up of the pattern into domains. The
results are consistent with recent experiments on electro-convection in nematic
liquid crystals by de la Torre and Rehberg. We also apply the general analysis
to a model of the behavior near a Lifshitz point, where the angle of
obliqueness vanishes. This analysis indicates that phase-locked standing
rectangles are always unstable in this parameter regime.
