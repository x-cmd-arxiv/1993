a focus on whether the observed segregation in clusters is local or global, and
whether there is bulge-disk segregation on large-scales. The high concentration
of bulge-rich galaxies in the cores of clusters of galaxies can be accounted
for by several popular physical processes: 1) biased early elliptical
formation, 2) abortion of disk formation by tidal destruction of the gas
reservoirs that fuel such disks, 3) ram pressure stripping of the gas in disks
by intergalactic gas, 4) merging of spiral galaxies into ellipticals (which is
the main focus of this review). A global scenario is outlined incorporating
each of these processes.

energy distribution of elliptical galaxies over the whole frequency range from
UV to far--IR. Internal extinction and far--IR re--emission by interstellar
dust have been taken into account in a self--consistent way. Diffuse dust
emission has been modelled in terms of two components: warm dust, located in
regions of high radiation intensity, and cold dust, heated by the general
radiation field. Emission from circumstellar dust clouds at different galactic
ages was also taken into account. The models reproduce well the present average
broad--band spectrum of nearby ellipticals over about four decades in
frequency. Under the assumption of a dust--to--gas ratio proportional to the
metallicity, the fraction of bolometric luminosity coming out at far-IR
wavelengths strongly evolves during the galaxy lifetime, ranging from very low
local values ($\lsim 0.5\%$) to $\sim 30\%$ or more in the first billion years.
Some models even imply that early phases are optically thick; these models
provide an excellent fit of the observed spectral energy distribution of the
high redshift galaxy IRAS F10214$+$4724. Far--IR observations may thus play a
key role in investigating the early evolution of elliptical galaxies. A strong
far-IR evolution of early-type galaxies might be a crucial ingredient to
explain the deep $60\mic$ IRAS counts.

field theory using the formalism of the $S$-matrix generating functional. In
the process we clarify the connection between two ways of calculating the
$S$-matrix, the one using the Feynman rule and the other using the classical
solution to the nonlinear equation of motion. We develop the formalism for
general backgrounds and apply it to the gravitational sine-Gordon model in
detail. We reproduce the conformal field theory calculation which was based on
expanding around the static $c=1$ theory. Furthermore, we prove that the tree-
level partition function of this model shows the scaling behavior corresponding
to $c=0$ model in the limit $p \to 0$ of sine-Gordon `momentum' $p$.

superdifferential operator with a particular type of constraint can be
covariantized only when it is of odd order. In such a case, the action of
superconformal transformation on the superdifferential operator is nothing but
a hamiltonian flow defined by the corresponding supersymmetric second
Gelfand-Dickey bracket. The covariant form of a superdifferential operator of
odd order is given.

model of coupled oscillators. The population is described by a Fokker-Planck
equation for the distribution of phases, and we apply center-manifold reduction
to obtain the amplitude equations for steady-state and Hopf bifurcation from
the equilibrium state with a uniform phase distribution. When the population is
described by a native frequency distribution that is reflection-symmetric about
zero, the problem has circular symmetry. In the limit of zero extrinsic noise,
although the critical eigenvalues are embedded in the continuous spectrum, the
nonlinear coefficients in the amplitude equation remain finite in contrast to
the singular behavior found in similar instabilities described by the
Vlasov-Poisson equation. For a bimodal reflection-symmetric distribution, both
types of bifurcation are possible and they coincide at a codimension-two Takens
Bogdanov point. The steady-state bifurcation may be supercritical or
subcritical and produces a time-independent synchronized state. The Hopf
bifurcation produces both supercritical stable standing waves and supercritical
unstable travelling waves. Previous work on the Hopf bifurcation in a bimodal
population by Bonilla, Neu, and Spigler and Okuda and Kuramoto predicted stable
travelling waves and stable standing waves, respectively. A comparison to these
previous calculations shows that the prediction of stable travelling waves
results from a failure to include all unstable modes.
