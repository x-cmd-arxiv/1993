possible to perform in the next generation linear colliders. We consider
processes which provide sensitive probes of the basic ingredients of the model:
right-handed gauge bosons, right-handed Majorana neutrinos, lepton number
violating interactions and triplet Higgs scalars. A supersymmetric version of
the left-right model is also studied and some distinctive experimental tests
for it is proposed. One of the main messages of this talk is to emphasize the
usefulness of the collision modes $e^-e^-$, $e^-\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma$ for
the tests of the left-right symmetric model.

vanishing baryon number are estimated using the ideal gas approximation and
taking into account resonance decays and annihilation processes as the only
sources of particle number fluctuations. Near the QCD critical temperature the
longest relaxation times turn out to be of the order of 10 fm and grow roughly
exponentially to become of the order of $10^{3}$ fm at temperatures around 100
MeV. As a consequence of such long relaxation times, a clear departure from
chemical equilibrium must be observed in the momentum distribution of secondary
particles produced in high energy nuclear collisions.

surface with abelian group of symmetry: a) The $b-c$ systems on a Riemann
surface $M$ are equivalent to a multivalued field theory on the complex plane
if $M$ is represented as an algebraic curve; b) the amplitudes of the $b-c$
systems on a Riemann surface $M$ with discrete group of symmetry can be derived
from the operator product expansions on the complex plane of an holonomic
quantum field theory a la Sato, Jimbo and Miwa. To this purpose, the solutions
of the Riemann-Hilbert problem on an algebraic curve with abelian monodromy
group obtained by Zamolodchikov, Knizhnik and Bershadskii-Radul are used in
order to expand the $b-c$ fields in a Fourier-like basis. The amplitudes of the
$b-c$ systems on the Riemann surface are then recovered exploiting simple
normal ordering rules on the complex plane.

satisfies, by virtue of a Young-tableau-transposition symmetry, the topological
constraint that any branched covering of an orientable or nonorientable surface
without boundary must have an {\em even} branch point multiplicity. This
statement holds for each chiral sector and requires multiple branch point
behavior for the twist points, since cross-terms appear that couple twist
points with odd powers of simple branch points. We obtain the same result for
the complete partition function of $\son$ and $\spn$ Yang-Mills$_2$ theory.

that interpolate nonlinearly with the statistical parameter contributes to the
third virial coefficient of a free anyon gas. Rather than evaluating the full
three-body partition function as was done in an earlier publication (Phys. Rev.
{\bf A46}, 4693 (1992)), here only the nonlinear contribution is calculated,
thus avoiding delicate cancellations between the irrelevant linear part and the
two-body partition function. Our numerical results are consistent with the
simple analytical form suggested recently by Myrheim and Olaussen.
