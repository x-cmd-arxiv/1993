model using the particle-hole mapping. The analysis simplifies near the
ferromagnetic limit. We find that the two dimensional(2D) Hubbard model has a
charge excitation gap at half-filling for any finite U in this region on both
the bipartite square lattice and the nonbipartite triangular lattice. In some
cases, the system goes through a first-order phase transition to become a
paramagnetic metal as $S_{z}$ is lowered. We also discuss the extension to the
doped case. We find that in the large U limit, a single doped hole has a
bandwidth of order of J rather than t at $S_{z}=0$.

Fermions through a barrier by numerically calculating the Kohn charge stiffness
constant and the relative Drude weight. We find that the transport properties
of the 1D Hubbard model are quite different from those of the 1D spinless
Fermion model. For example, the presence of the attractive interaction between
electrons in the 1D Hubbard model actually {\em suppresses} the DC conductance,
while a small repulsive interaction {\em enhances} the DC conductance. These
results show that the spin degree of freedom plays an important role in the
transport properties of the 1D interacting Fermion systems.

results are compared with the recent CLEO data, and we find good agreement
except for the $\cos\theta_{\pi}^*$ distributions. We argue that the
$\cos\theta_{\pi}^*$ distribution, contrary to other distributions, is
sensitive to the higher order corrections in the pion momentum expansion. This
argument is supported by using an ansatz for the amplitude which is of higher
order in the pion momentum expansion and still satisfies the soft pion theorem.

that a configuration p of the order parameter (Polyakov loop) occurs. They are
important in the analysis of surface effects and bubble formation in the
plasma. The vector potential appears non-linearly in the loop; in weak coupling
the linear term gives rise to the traditional free energy graphs. But the
non-linear terms generate insertions of the constrained modes into the free
energy graphs, through renormalisations of the Polyakov loop. These insertions
are gauge dependent and are necessary to cancel the gauge dependence of the
free energy graphs. The latter is shown, through the BRST identities, to have
again the form of constrained mode insertions. It also follows, that absolute
minima of the potential are at the centergroup values of the loop. We evaluate
the two-loop contributions for SU(N) gauge theories, with and without quarks,
for the full domain of the N-1 variables.
