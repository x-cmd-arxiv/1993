  CFA-3709","Astrophys.J. 419 (1993) L9","10.1086/187124",,"astro-ph",,"  We employ N--body/$3D$ gas dynamic simulations of the formation of galaxy
clusters to determine whether cluster X--ray morphologies can be used as
cosmological constraints. Confirming the analytic expectations of Richstone,
Loeb, \& Turner, we demonstrate that cluster evolution is sensitive to the
cosmological model in which the clusters form. We further show that
evolutionary differences are echoed in the gross morphological features of the
cluster X--ray emission.
  We examine current--epoch X--ray images of models originating from the same
initial density fields evolved in three different cosmologies: (i) an unbiased,
low density universe with $\Omega_o \se 0.2$; (ii) an unbiased universe
dominated by vacuum energy with $\Omega_o \se 0.2$ and $\lambda_o \se 0.8$ and
(iii) a biased Einstein--deSitter model ($\Omega \se 1$, $\sigma_8=0.59$).
Using measures of X--ray morphology such as the axial ratio and centroid
shifting, we demonstrate that clusters evolved in the two low $\Omega_o$ models
are much more regular, spherically symmetric, and centrally condensed than
clusters evolved in the Einstein--deSitter model. This morphology--cosmology
connection, along with the availability of a large body of cluster X--ray
observations, makes cluster X--ray morphology both a powerful and a practical
cosmological discriminant.

presence of correlated disorder is studied using functional renormalization
group techniques. The model exhibits many of the features of the Bose glass
phase of type II superconductors induced by columnar defects, but may be more
directly applicable to charge density waves, incommensurate striped magnetic
phases, stacked membranes under tension, vicinal crystal surfaces, or
superconducting ``vortex--chains''. Below five dimensions, an epsilon expansion
for the stable zero temperature fixed point yields the properties of the glassy
phase. Transverse to the direction of correlation, the randomness induces
logarithmic growth of displacements. Displacements are strongly localized in
the correlation direction. The absence of a response to a weak applied
transverse field (transverse Meissner effect) is demonstrated analytically. In
this simple model, the localized phase is stable to point disorder, in contrast
to the behavior in the presence of dislocations, in which the converse is
believed to be true.

for chiral gauge theories, or other models in which a straightforward
discretization leads to a lattice action $S^\pr$ in which gauge invariance is
broken. The lattice action is `almost' gauge invariant, because a local gauge
transformation leaves the action the same, up to a global gauge transformation.
In this approach the action $S$ for all gauge fields on a gauge orbit is the
same as that of the action $S^\pr$ evaluated for the gauge field fixed to a
smooth gauge. To define $S$ unambiguously, it must be possible to compute the
gauge fixed field unambiguously. This rules out gauge conditions which suffer
from Gribov ambiguities but it can be achieved by using the recently proposed
Laplacian gauge. When using the almost gauge invariant action $S$ in a
numerical simulation, it is not necessary to fix the gauge, and hence gauge
fixing terms and Fadeev-Popov ghosts are not required. A hybrid Monte Carlo
algorithm for simulations with this new action is described and tested on a
simple toy model.
