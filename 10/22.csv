fluctuations in the early universe can be gained by testing the Gaussian nature
of the fluctuations through cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR)
temperature anisotropy experiments. One of the crucial aspects of density
perturbations that are produced by the standard inflation scenario is that they
are Gaussian, whereas seeds produced by topological defects left over from an
early cosmic phase transition tend to be non-Gaussian. To carry out this test,
sophisticated statistical tools are required. In this paper, we will discuss
several such statistical tools, including multivariant skewness and kurtosis,
  Euler-Poincare characteristics, the three point temperature correlation
function, and the Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic defined through bispectral
estimates of a one dimensional dataset. The effect of noise present in the
current data is discussed in detail and the COBE 53 GHz dataset is analyzed.
Our analysis shows that, on the large angular scale to which COBE is sensitive,
the statistics are probably Gaussian. On the small angular scales, the
importance of Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic is stressed, and the minimum sample
size required to test Gaussianity is estimated. Although the current dataset
available from various experiments at half-degree scales is still too small,
improvement of the dataset by roughly a factor of two will be enough to test
the Gaussianity statistically. On the arcminute scales, we analyze the recent
RING data through bispectral analysis, and the result

incompatible with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Indeed, for a `trivial' theory
the effective potential should be given exactly by the classical potential plus
the free-field zero-point energy of the shifted field; i.e., by the one-loop
effective potential. When this is renormalized in a simple, but nonperturbative
way, one finds, self-consistently, that the shifted field does become
non-interacting in the continuum limit. For a classically scale-invariant (CSI)
lambda Phi^4 theory one finds m_h^2 = 8 pi^2 v^2, predicting a 2.2 TeV Higgs
boson. Here we extend our earlier work in three ways: (i) we discuss the
analogy with the hard-sphere Bose gas; (ii) we extend the analysis from the CSI
case to the general case; and (iii) we propose a test of the predicted shape of
the effective potential that could be tested in a lattice simulation.
