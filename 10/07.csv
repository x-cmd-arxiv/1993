  Structure Formation","4 pages,IUCAA-23/93; sept,93; submitted for publication",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The recent detection of microlensing of stars of LMC by compact objects in
the halo of our galaxy suggests that our galaxy is surrounded by a non-luminous
halo made of compact objects with mass of about $(0.03-0.5) \msun$. The rate of
detection could be consistent with the assumption that these halo objects are
distributed with a softened isothermal profile with a core radius of $(2-8)$Kpc
and asymptotic circular velocity of $220\kms$. Taken in isolation, this
observation is consistent with a universe having only baryonic dark matter
(BDM, hereafter) contributing $\Omega_b=\Omega_{total}\simeq0.06$ which will,
however, violently contradict several other large scale observations, notably
the COBE-DMR results. Alternatively one can assume that galaxies like ours are
surrounded by both BDM and non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM, hereafter). A model
with a single component for NBDM with, say,
$\Omega_b\simeq0.06,\Omega_{cdm}\simeq0.94$, is also ruled out if we demand
that: (i) at least thirty percent of the dark matter density within $100$ kpc
is baryonic and (ii) galactic structures should have collapsed by redshift of
$z=1$. Further if half or more of the dark matter within $100 kpc$ is baryonic
then the maximum value of $\Omega_{dm}$, contributed by NBDM clustered at
galactic scales, can only be about $\Omega_{max}\simeq0.29$. Models with C+HDM
cannot satisfy this constraint but $\Lambda$+ CDM models are still

developed in the present paper. There are 2 new main results : 1) We extend the
method of CDJ to arbitrary matter-coupling again for non-degenerate metrics :
the new feature is that the 'CDJ-matrix' adopts a nontrivial antisymmetric part
when solving the vector constraint and that the Klein-Gordon-field is used,
instead of the symmetric part of the CDJ-matrix, in order to satisfy the scalar
constraint. 2) The 2nd result is that one can solve the general initial value
constraints for arbitrary matter coupling by a method which is completely
independent of that of CDJ. It is shown how the Yang-Mills and gravitational
Gauss constraints can be solved explicitely for the corresponding electric
fields. The rest of the constraints can then be satisfied by using either
scalar or spinor field momenta. This new trick might be of interest also for
Yang-Mills theories on curved backgrounds.

The argument is formulated in the framework of the standard pole model with

states for the P- and S- waves respectively. Under the assumption that the
dominant part of the deviation of $(f/d)_{P-wave}$ from $-1$ is due to large
quark sea effects, $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking in energy denominators is shown to
lead to a prediction for $(f/d)_{S-wave}$ which is in excellent agreement with
experiment. This corroborates our previous unitarity calculations which
indicated that the matrix elements $<B|H^{p.c.}_{weak}|B'>$ of the parity
conserving weak Hamiltonian between the ground-state baryons are characterized
