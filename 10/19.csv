i}$) for a total of 84 galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae (PNe) at
known distances. To do these calculations, we have chosen forbidden line
electron densities, observed angular diameters, and H${\beta}$ fluxes, from the
most recent measurements available in the literature. Statistical analysis on
the distributions of ${\varepsilon}$ and ${\rm M_i}$ show that (1) the ranges
of values of these parameters is wider than what was previously found; (2) the
mean value of the filling factor is between $0.3$ and $0.4$, for the different
sets; (3) the mean value of the ionized mass is between $0.1$ and $0.25$
$M_{\odot}$; (4) a clear correlation between the filling factors and the
dimensions of the PNe was not found when distance-independent sets of PNe were
used; (5) for extragalactic PNe, where distance errors are not a factor, the
filling factors and the ionized masses anticorrelate tightly with the electron
densities. The results indicate that the modified Shklowsky distance method is
correct.

scheme the chiral soliton is investigated for the case of three flavors within
the framework of the bound state approach to strangeness. For this purpose
meson fluctuations off the non--strange soliton are considered. For the kaon
P--wave channel the emerging Bethe--Salpeter equation is solved yielding the
bound state energy and wave--function. This kaon bound state also induces a
strange valence quark wave--function. Collective coordinates are introduced for
the SU(2) isorotations and the coupling of the bound state to these rotations
is determined. The total spin is decomposed into parts carried by the soliton
and the bound state. The absolute value of the former is identical to the total
isospin while the latter is demonstrated to be identical to the expectation
value of the grand spin, the sum of spin and isospin. The functional trace
involves quark states with various grand spins which get polarized by the kaon
bound state. This polarization results in a normalization of the coupling
between the collective rotation and the bound state different from the Skyrme
model. Nevertheless after quantization the expression for the baryon masses can
be cast into the form found by Callan and Klebanov for the Skyrme model.
Numerical results for the baryon spectrum are compared to those obtained in the
same model using the collective approach of Yabu and Ando. It is found that for
$\frac{1}{2}^+$ baryons the bound state treatment reproduces the experimental
data better than the collective approach while there are only small differences
between the two approaches for the $\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons. Both treatments
underestimate the mass splittings for baryons with different strangeness. This
short-coming is conjectured to be inherited from the meson sector of the NJL
model where too small a ratio of the kaon and pion decay constants is
predicted.
