"math/9310220",,"Antonio J. Dur\'an, Walter Van Assche","Orthogonal matrix polynomials and higher order recurrence relations",,,,"OP-SF 5 Oct 1993","math.CA",,"  It is well-known that orthogonal polynomials on the real line satisfy a
three-term recurrence relation and conversely every system of polynomials
satisfying a three-term recurrence relation is orthogonal with respect to some
positive Borel measure on the real line. In this paper we extend this result
and show that every system of polynomials satisfying some $(2N+1)$-term
recurrence relation can be expressed in terms of orthonormal matrix polynomials
for which the coefficients are $N\times N$ matrices. We apply this result to
polynomials orthogonal with respect to a discrete Sobolev inner product and
other inner products in the linear space of polynomials. As an application we
give a short proof of Krein's characterization of orthogonal polynomials with a
spectrum having a finite number of accumulation points.

of $e^{ixy}$ in Jacobi polynomials of argument $x$. We also outline a general
procedure of finding integral representations for inverses of linear operators.

derivation of relativistic transport equations in the frame of nonequilibrium
Green's function technique including medium effects as well as flucuation
effects. It contains all possible processes due to one meson exchange and
special attention is kept to the off--shell character of the particles. As a
new feature of many particle effects, processes are possible which can be
interpreted as particle creation and annihilation due to in-medium one meson
exchange. In-medium cross sections are obtained from the generalized derivation
of collision integrals, which possess complete crossing symmetries.
