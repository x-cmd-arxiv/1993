proposed a possible mirror partner (which is also a family of Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces). We explain a natural construction of the isomorphism between
certain Hodge groups of these hypersurfaces, as predicted by mirror symmetry,
which we call the monomial-divisor mirror map. We indicate how this map can be
interpreted as the differential of the expected mirror isomorphism between the
moduli spaces of the two Calabi-Yau manifolds. We formulate a very precise
conjecture about the form of that mirror isomorphism, which when combined with
some earlier conjectures of the third author would completely specify it. We
then conclude that the moduli spaces of the nonlinear sigma models whose
targets are the different birational models of a Calabi-Yau space should be
connected by analytic continuation, and that further analytic continuation
should lead to moduli spaces of other kinds of conformal field theories. (This
last conclusion was first drawn by Witten.)

$\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})$ $(\tilde{\Lambda}_{\overline{MS}})$ with attendant scheme
dependence uncertainties therefore reflect the ad hoc way in which they were
extracted, rather than the actual values of these parameters. Choosing the
scale so that the NLO coefficient vanishes (effective charge scheme) exposes
the relative size of these unknown RS invariant higher order terms. They are
seen to be sizeable for some of the LEP observables, indicating that they must
be estimated if $\tilde{\Lambda}_{\overline{MS}}$ is to be determined reliably.
This can be accomplished either from NNLO calculations, at present only

non-perturbatively by writing the RS-invariant uncertainty in $\tilde{\Lambda}$

established that a necessary and sufficient condition for solving the former is
the nonempty intersection of the family of cones, and one such condition for
solving the latter is the acyclicity of the unions of its subfamilies. We show
an unexpected but clear connection between the two problems by establishing a
duality property of the homology groups of the nerve defined by the family of
cones. In particular, we prove that the intersection of the family of cones is
nonempty if and only if every subfamily has acyclic unions, thus identifying
the two conditions that solve the two economic problems. In addition to their
applications to economics, the results are shown to extend significantly
several classical theorems, providing unified and simple proofs: Helly's
theorem, Caratheodory's representation theorem, the
Knaster-Kuratowski-Marzukiewicz theorem, Brouwer's fixed point theorem, and
Leray's theorem on acyclic covers.

concerns extending the class of integrable functions. In contrast, our
viewpoint is akin to that taken by Hassler Whitney [{\it Geometric integration
theory}, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, NJ, 1957] and by geometric measure
theorists because we extend the class of integrable {\it domains}. Let $\omega$
be an $n$-form defined on $\Bbb R^m$. We show that if $\omega$ is sufficiently
smooth, it may be integrated over sufficiently controlled, but nonsmooth,
domains $\gamma$. The smoother is $ \omega$, the rougher may be $\gamma$.
Allowable domains include a large class of nonsmooth chains and topological
$n$-manifolds immersed in $\Bbb R^m$. We show that our integral extends the
Lebesgue integral and satisfies a generalized Stokes' theorem.

does not have a total set of orthogonal frequencies, but a harmonic analysis of

are present when a random graph on $n$ vertices has approximately $\half n$
edges. In particular, we show that such a graph consists entirely of trees,
unicyclic components, and bicyclic components with probability approaching
$\sqrt{2\over 3} \cosh\sqrt{5\over 18}\approx0.9325$ as $n\to\infty$. The
limiting probability that it consists of trees, unicyclic components, and at
most one other component is approximately 0.9957; the limiting probability that
it is planar lies between 0.987 and 0.9998. When a random graph evolves and the
number of edges passes $\half n$, its components grow in cyclic complexity
according to an interesting Markov process whose asymptotic structure is
derived. The probability that there never is more than a single component with
more edges than vertices, throughout the evolution, approaches
$5\pi/18\approx0.8727$. A ``uniform'' model of random graphs, which allows
self-loops and multiple edges, is shown to lead to formulas that are
substantially simpler than the analogous formulas for the classical random
graphs of Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi. The notions of ``excess'' and ``deficiency,''
which are significant characteristics of the generating function as well as of
the graphs themselves, lead to a mathematically attractive structural theory
for the uniform model. A general approach to the study of stopping
configurations makes it possible to sharpen previously obtained estimates in a
uniform manner and often to obtain closed forms for the constants of interest.
Empirical results are presented to complement the analysis, indicating the
typical behavior when $n$ is near 20000.
