Universe. They arise in most unified theories of strong, weak and
electromagnetic interactions. These lectures focus on the role of topological
defects in cosmology, with particular emphasis on the models of structure
formation based on defects. The role of topological defects in baryogenesis is
also reviewed.

showthat the one-dimensional Hubbard model on the infinite chain has the
infinite-dimensional algebra of symmetries. This algebra is a direct sum of two
$ sl(2) $-Yangians. This $ Y(sl(2)) \oplus Y(sl(2)) $ symmetry is an extension
of the well-known $ sl(2) \oplus sl(2) $ . The deformation parameters of the
Yangians are equal up to the signs to the coupling constant of the Hubbard
model hamiltonian.

  (Another prescription for extracting the exact antisymmetric tensor is
  described leading to a purely semiclassical expression for it)","Phys.Rev.D49:2933-2956,1994","10.1103/PhysRevD.49.2933",,"hep-th",,"  String backgrounds associated with gauged $G/H$ WZNW models generically
depend on $\alpha'$ or $1/k$. The exact expressions for the corresponding
metric $G_{\m\n}$, antisymmetric tensor $B_{\m\n}$, and dilaton $\phi$ can be
obtained by eliminating the $2d$ gauge field from the local part of the
effective action of the gauged WZNW model. We show that there exists a
manifestly gauge-invariant prescription for the derivation of the antisymmetric
tensor coupling. When the subgroup $H$ is one-dimensional and $G$ is simple the
antisymmetric tensor is given by the semiclassical ($\alpha'$-independent)
expression. We consider in detail the simplest non-trivial example with
non-trivial $B_{\m\n}$ -- the D=3 sigma model corresponding to the $[SL(2,R) x
R]/R$ gauged WZNW theory (`charged black string') and show that the exact
expressions for $G_{\m\n}$, $B_{\m\n}$ and $\phi$ solve the Weyl invariance
conditions in the two-loop approximation. Similar conclusion is reached for the
closely related $SL(2,R)/R$ chiral gauged WZNW model. We find that there exists
a scheme in which the semiclassical background is also a solution of the
two-loop conformal invariance equations (but the tachyon equation takes a
non-canonical form). We discuss in detail the role of field redefinitions
(scheme dependence) in establishing a correspondence between the sigma model
and conformal field theory results.
