  cond-mat/yymmnnn",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.49.8227",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the transition between sharp and smooth density distributions at the
edges of Quantum Hall Liquids in the presence of interactions. We find that,
for strong confining potentials, the edge of a $\nu=1$ liquid is described by
the $Z_F=1$ Fermi Liquid theory, even in the presence of interactions, a
consequence of the chiral nature of the system. When the edge confining
potential is decreased beyond a point, the edge undergoes a reconstruction and
electrons start to deposit a distance $\sim 2$ magnetic lengths away from the
initial QH Liquid. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation, a new pair of
branches of gapless edge excitations is generated after the transition. We show
that the transition is controlled by the balance between a long-ranged
repulsive Hartree term and a short-ranged attractive exchange term. Such
transition also occurs for Quantum Dots in the Quantum Hall Regime, and should
be observable in resonant tunneling experiments. Electron tunneling into the
reconstructed edge is also discussed.

distribution of the fuse network may or may not completely change the
subsequent breakdown process. When the threshold distribution has a lower
cutoff at a finite value and a power law dependence towards large thresholds
with an exponent which is less than $0.16\pm0.03$, the network is not sensitive
to the added noise, otherwise it is. The transition between sensitivity or not
appears to be second order, and is related to a localization-delocalization
transition earlier observed in such systems.
