identical to DAOFIND, 3) aperture photometry, and 4) ALLSTAR profile-fitting

sky brightness or image resolution varied by a factor of three. The gains in
s/n were modest for most of the examples, except for DAOFIND detection with
varying image resolution which exhibited a substantial s/n increase. Even
though the only consideration was maximizing s/n, the image resolution was seen
to improve for most of the variable resolution examples. Also discussed are
empirical fits for the weighting and the availability of the program, WEIGHT,
used to generate the weighting for the individual frames. Finally, we include
appendices describing the effects of clipping algorithms and a scheme for

problem; the task of explaining temporal asymmetry reduces in the main to that
of explaining an aspect of the condition of the early universe. However,
cosmologists who discuss these issues often make mistakes similar to those that
plagued nineteenth century discussions of the statistical foundations of
thermodynamics. In particular, they are often guilty of applying temporal
""double standards"" of various kinds---e.g., in failing to recognise that
certain statistical arguments apply with equal force in either temporal
direction. This paper aims to clarify the issue as to what would count as
adequate explanation of cosmological time asymmetry. A particular concern is
the question whether it is possible to explain why entropy is low near the Big
Bang without showing that it must also be low near a Big Crunch, in the event
that the universe recollapses. I criticise some of the objections raised to
this possibility, showing that these too often depend on a temporal double
standard. I also discuss briefly some issues that arise if we take the view
seriously. (Could we observe a time- reversing future, for example?)

primarily by a naturally generated composite scalar which simulates Higgs

broken down to subgroups like SU(5) or SU(5)$\times$U(1).
