  Title !!","J.Phys.I(France) 4 (1994) 181-186","10.1051/jp1:1994131",,"cond-mat",,"  We estimate, using a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation, the critical
exponents of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a stacked triangular
lattice. We obtain the following estimates: $\gamma/\nu= 2.011 \pm .014 $,
$\nu= .585 \pm .009 $. These results contradict a perturbative $2+\epsilon$
Renormalization Group calculation that points to Wilson-Fisher O(4) behaviour.
While these results may be coherent with $4-\epsilon$ results from
Landau-Ginzburg analysis, they show the existence of an unexpectedly rich
structure of the Renormalization Group flow as a function of the dimensionality
and the number of components of the order parameter.

coupling constants. Without an intermediate mass scale, the minimal
supersymmetric standard model is the only possibility. For one intermediate
mass scale, it is possible to have many routes toward grand unification:
$SO(10)\rightarrow SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1) , SU(7),

unification.

Furthermore, we construct a canonical transformation which maps the theory into
a free-field form, i.e. the constraints become free-field Virasoro generators
with background charges. This implies the gauge independence of the
David-Distler-Kawai results, and also proves the free-field assumption which
was used for obtaining the spectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. A
discussion of the unitarity of the physical spectrum is presented and we point
out that the scalar products of the discrete states are not well defined in the
standard Fock space framework.

energy momentum tensor in the neighbourhood of a plane boundary are
investigated, restricting the conformal group to those transformations leaving
the boundary invariant. It is shown that the general solution may contain an
arbitrary function of a single conformally invariant variable $v$, except in
dimension 2. The functional dependence on $v$ is determined for free scalar and
fermion fields in arbitrary dimension $d$ and also to leading order in the
$\vep$ expansion about $d=4$ for the non Gaussian fixed point in $\phi^4$
theory. The two point correlation function of the energy momentum tensor and a
scalar field is also shown to have a unique expression in terms of $v$ and the
overall coefficient is determined by the operator product expansion. The energy
momentum tensor on a general curved manifold is further discussed by
considering variations of the metric. In the presence of a boundary this
procedure naturally defines extra boundary operators. By considering
diffeomorphisms these are related to components of the energy momentum tensor
on the boundary. The implications of Weyl invariance in this framework are also
derived.

new configurations of internal fields which produce wormhole solutions in four

due to specific form of the moduli and these transformations belong to a
