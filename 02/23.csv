reproduce the correlations on large angular scales. We come to a similar
conclusion about CDM models with positively skewed initial fluctuation
distributions. In contrast, models with initially negatively skewed
fluctuations produce a $w(\vartheta)$ that declines much more gently on large

of large--scale power of the CDM spectrum with the observed clustering of APM

practical example is the derivation of an effective (quasi-)potential for the

our early results on viewing the symmetry behavior of constant background
fields in curved but static spacetimes as finite size effect, and the use of
derivative expansions for constructing effective actions for slowly-varying
background fields. We then introduce the notion of dynamical finite size effect
to explain how an exponential expansion of the scale factor imparts a finite
size to the system and how the symmetry behavior in de Sitter space can be
understood qualitatively in this light. We reason why the exponential inflation
can be described equivalently by a scale transformation, thus rendering this
special class of dynamics as effectively static. Finally we show how, in this
view, one can treat the class of `slow-roll' inflation as a dynamic
perturbation off the effectively static class of exponential inflation and
understand it as a dynamical critical phenomenon in cosmology.

holons}. We study the quantization of the charges of these objects and its
compatibility with duality symmetry. In general the spectrum of black-hole
solutions with quantized charges is not invariant under $SL(2,R)$ but only
under $SL(2,Z)$ or one of its subgroups $\Gamma_{l}$. Because of their
transformation properties, the asymptotic value of the axion-dilaton field of a
black hole may be associated with the modular parameter $\tau$ of some complex
torus and the integer numbers $(n,m)$ that label its quantized electric and
magnetic charges may be associated with winding numbers.

deformation parameter $q$ of the algebra is related to the anyonic statistical

spectra where the hypercentral approximation is valid. We illustrate this by
considering an harmonic oscillator potential which has been altered by changing
the energy or normalisation constant of the ground state of the n-body system
and finding how this modifies the two-body potential. It is shown that with
increasing number of particles the spectrum must be known more precisely to
obtain the two-body potential to the same degree of accuracy.
