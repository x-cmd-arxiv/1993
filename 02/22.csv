quantum uncertainty of the space-time geometry and leads to absurd physical
consequences. The given model can thus not account for gradual violation of
quantum coherence and can not predict tiny experimental effects either.

  KEK-TH-353","Phys.Rev.D48:1990-1999,1993","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.1990",,"hep-ph",,"  If high mass di-gamma events observed at LEP are due to the production of a
di-gamma resonance via its leptonic coupling, its consequences can be observed
at TRISTAN. We find that a predicted $Z$ decay branching rate is too small to
account for the observed events if the resonance spin is zero, due to a strong
cancellation in the decay amplitudes. Such a cancellation is absent if the
resonance has a spin two. We study the consequences of a tensor production in
the processes $e^+e^- \to e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\gamma\,\gamma$ at TRISTAN
energies. Complete helicity amplitudes with tensor boson exchange contributions
are given, and the signal can clearly be identified from various distributions.
TRISTAN experiments are also sensitive to the virtual tensor boson exchange
effects, which reduce to the contact interaction terms in the high mass limit.

Both the internal bremsstrahlung and the structure dependent radiation have
been taken into account. To this aim we have parametrized the form factors
$F_V$ and $F_A$, which determine the structure dependent radiation. Observables
especially suited for the measurement of the structure dependent form factors
are found and implications on the width of the $a_1$ discussed.

gauge symmetry $SU(n)_c\otimes SU(m)_L\otimes U(1)_N$. Although the most
interesting possibilities occur when $n=3$, we will consider also the cases
$n=4,5$ both with $m=3,4$. Models with left-right symmetry, horizontal
symmetries and the possible embedding in a larger group (grand unification
scenarios) are briefly discussed.

"hep-th/9302099","A. Sagnotti","Augusto Sagnotti","Anomaly Cancellations and Open-String Theories","plain TEX",,,"ROM2F-93/5","hep-th",,"  In models of oriented closed strings, anomaly cancellations are deeply linked
to the {\it modular invariance} of the torus amplitude. If open and/or
unoriented strings are allowed, there are no non-trivial modular
transformations in the additional genus-one amplitudes (Klein bottle, annulus
and M\""obius strip). As originally recognized by Green and Schwarz, in the
ten-dimensional type-I superstring the anomaly cancellation results from a
delicate interplay between the contributions of these additional surfaces. In
lower-dimensional models, the possible presence of a number of antisymmetric
tensors yields a generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. I illustrate
these results by referring to some six-dimensional chiral models, and I
conclude by addressing the additional difficulties that one meets when trying
to extend the construction to chiral four-dimensional models. (Contribution to

formalism come out. If $\kappa_s > 0 $, where $\kappa_s =(N-27)/12\pi $ and $N$
is the number of matter fields, a singularity appears, while for $\kappa_s <0$
the singularity disappears. The quantum dynamics of black hole seems to be
changed by the sign of $\kappa_s $.
