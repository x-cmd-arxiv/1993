scatterers when an external field is applied and the particle kinetic energy is
held fixed by a ``thermostat'' constructed according to Gauss' principle of
least constraint (a model problem previously studied numerically by Moran and
Hoover). The resulting dynamics is reversible and deterministic, but does not
preserve Liouville measure. For a sufficiently small field, we prove the
following results: (1) existence of a unique stationary, ergodic measure
obtained by forward evolution of initial absolutely continuous distributions,
for which the Pesin entropy formula and Young's expression for the fractal
dimension are valid; (2) exact identity of the steady-state thermodyamic
entropy production, the asymptotic decay of the Gibbs entropy for the
time-evolved distribution, and minus the sum of the Lyapunov exponents; (3) an
explicit expression for the full nonlinear current response (Kawasaki formula);
and (4) validity of linear response theory and Ohm's transport law, including
the Einstein relation between conductivity and diffusion matrices. Results (2)
and (4) yield also a direct relation between Lyapunov exponents and zero-field
transport (=diffusion) coefficients. Although we restrict ourselves here to
dimension $d=2,$ the results carry over to higher dimensions and to some other
physical situations: e.g. with additional external magnetic fields. The proofs
use a well-developed theory of small perturbations of hyperbolic dynamical
systems and the method of Markov sieves, an approximation of Markov partitions.
In our context we discuss also the van Kampen objection to linear response
theory, which, we point out, overlooks the ``structural stability'' of strongly
hyperbolic flows.

processes which scatter electrons {\em into} a state $|{\bf k}\rangle$ can
contribute strongly to the decay of a nonequilibrium electron occupation of
$|{\bf k}\rangle$. For electrons, the decay rate $\gamma({\bf k})$ is given by
the sum of the total scattering-out {\em and scattering-in} rates of state
$|{\bf k}\rangle$. The scattering-in term, which is often neglected in
calculations, increases $\gamma({\bf k})$ of low energy electrons injected into
semidegenerate systems, which includes many doped semiconductor structures at
nonzero temperatures, particularly those of reduced dimensions.

creation and annihilation operators, and how to construct a supersymmetic
