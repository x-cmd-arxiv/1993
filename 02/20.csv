large but finite systems. The methods presented allow a simple interpretation
of the results. For finite range interactions interesting nonunivesal spectral
features emerge for momenta which differ from the Fermi points by the order of
the inverse interaction range or more. For a simplified model with interactions
only within the branches of right and left moving electrons analytical
expressions for the spectral function are presented which allows to perform the
thermodynamic limit. As in the general spinless model and the model including
spin for which we present mainly numerical results the spectral functions do
not approach the noninteracting limit for large momenta. The implication of our
results for recent high resolution photoemission measurements on quasi
one-dimensional conductors are discussed.

"cond-mat/9302032",,"Myung-Hoon Chung","Many Particle Hamiltonian for the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect","24 pages, 4 figures available from lois@control, Latex, EFI 92-47",,,,"cond-mat",,"  A many-particle Hamiltonian is proposed in order to explain the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) for fractional filling factors $\nu < 1$. The
solutions of the corresponding Hartree-Fock equations make it possible to
discuss the FQHE from the point of view of the single quasi-particle energy
spectrum. It is shown how the specific couplings in the many-particle
Hamiltonian depend on the magnetic field and the area density of electrons. The
degeneracies of the quasi-particle states are related to the fractional filling
factors $\nu$. It is suggested that the energy gaps obtained in the
quasi-particle energy spectrum are comparable with the experimentally measured
quantities. An explicit calculation for the FQH - conductance is given and its
character as a topological invariant is discussed.

and homogeneity of the observed universe, 2) how viewing minisuperspace as a
quantum open system can address the issue of the validity of such
approximations customarily adopted in quantum cosmology, and 3) how invoking
statistical processes like decoherence and correlation when considered together
can help to establish a theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime as the
semiclassical limit of quantum gravity. {\it Dedicated to Professor Misner on

Standard Model (MSSM) are allowed to have general values, the resulting neutron
EDM ($d_n$) exceeds the experimental upper limit by about $10^3$. We assume
that the needed suppression is not due to a fine-tuning of phases or masses,
and ask what natural size of $CP$ violation (CPV) results. We show that (1) the
phase of one of the superpotential parameters, $\mu$, does not contribute to
any CPV in the MSSM and so is not constrained by \dn; (2) the MSSM contribution
to $d_n$ is tiny, just coming from the CKM phase; (3) the phases in the MSSM
cannot be used to generate a baryon asymmetry at the weak scale, given our
assumptions; and (4) in non-minimal SUSY models, an effective phase can enter
at one loop giving $d_n \sim 10^{-26}$\ecm, $d_e \sim 10^{-27}$\ecm, and
allowing a baryon asymmetry to be generated at the weak scale, without
fine-tunings. Our results could be evaded by a SUSY breaking mechanism which
produced phases for the SUSY breaking parameters that somehow were naturally of
order $10^{-3}$.

  ZYNDA@IASSNS.BITNET, IASSNS HEP/93-12",,,,"hep-th",,"  Following Hawking, it is usual to mimic the effect of collapse space-time
geometry on quantum fields in a semi-classical approximation by imposing
suitable boundary conditions at the origin of coordinates, which effectively
becomes a moving mirror. Suitable mirror trajectories induces a close analogue
to the radiance of black holes, including a flux of outgoing radiation that
appears accurately thermal. If the acceleration of the mirror eventually ceases
the complete state of the radiation field is a pure quantum state, even though
it is indistinguishable from an accurately thermal state for an arbitrarily
long period of time and in a precise sense differs little from ``pure thermal''
closely followed by ``vacuum''. Suspicions that the semiclassical calculation
of black hole radiance gives evidence for the evolution of pure into mixed
states are criticized on this basis. Possible extensions of the model to mimic
black holes more accurately (including the effects of back reaction and partial
transparency), while remaining within the realm of tractable models, are
suggested.
