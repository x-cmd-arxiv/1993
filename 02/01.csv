the locus of points where it is not surjective which we call relative base

not meet the fiber. Consequently, in this case, we discuss the structure of the

effective potential is awkward. In such theories, the exact effective potential
$V(\phi_c,T)$ is real and convex (as a function of the classical field
$\phi_c$), but its perturbative series can be complex with a real part that is
concave. These flaws limit the utility of the effective potential, particularly
in studies of the early universe. A generalization of the effective potential
is available that is real, that has no obvious convexity problems, and that can
be computed in perturbation theory. For the theory with classical potential
$V(\phi) = (\lambda/4)(\phi^2 - \sigma^2)^2$, this more-effective potential
closely tracks the usual effective potential where the latter is real $|\phi_c|
\geq \sigma/\sqrt{3}$ and naturally extends it to $\phi_c = 0$, revealing that
the critical temperature at the one-loop level runs from $T_C \approx 1.81

meson-exchange currents in nuclei and applied to nuclear axial- charge
transitions. Calculation is performed to the next-to-leading order in chiral
expansion which involves graphs up to one loop. The result turns out to be very
simple. The previously conjectured notion of ""chiral filter mechanism"" in the
time component of the nuclear axial current and the space component of the
nuclear electromagnetic current is verified to that order. As a consequence,
the phenomenologically observed soft-pion dominance in the nuclear process is
given a simple interpretation in terms of chiral symmetry in nuclei. In this
paper, we focus on the axial current, relegating the EM current which can be
treated in a similar way to a separate paper. We discuss the implication of our
result on the enhanced axial-charge transitions observed in heavy nuclei and
clarify the relationship between the phenomenological meson-exchange
description and the chiral Lagrangian description.

supercoadjoint orbit of $OSp(1/2)$ by exhibiting the corresponding equivariant
supermoment map. Moreover, this supermanifold is shown to be a nontrivial
example of Rothstein's supersymplectic supermanifolds. More precisely, we show
that its supersymplectic structure is completely determined in terms of
$SU(1,1)$-invariant (but unrelated) K\""ahler $2$-form and K\""ahler metric on
the unit disc. This result allows us to define the notions of a superK\""ahler

of unity. Our discussion covers a range of topics including new integrable
deformations, thermodynamics, conformal behaviour, S-matrices and
magnetization. The emerging picture strongly depends on the N-parity. For the N
even case at the commensurable point, S-matrices factorize into N=2
supersymmetric Sine-Gordon matrix and an RSOS piece. The physics of the N odd
case is rather different. Here, the supersymmetry does not manifest itself and
the bootstrap hypothesis fails. Away from the commensurable point, we find an
unusual behaviour. The magnetization of our chains depends on the sign of the
external magnetic field.
