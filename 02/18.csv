renormalization serves as a test scheme for comparison. We write the basic
differential identities of the method simultaneously in co-ordinate and
momentum space, introducing two scales which remove ultraviolet and infrared
singularities. The consistent set of Fourier-transformation formulae is
derived. However, the values for tadpole-type Feynman integrals in higher

evaluation of the subgraphs. In two dimensions, even earlier than this
ambiguity manifests itself, renormalization-group calculations based on
infrared extension of differential renormalization lead to incorrect results.

with external nonrelativistic baryon wavefunctions attached to the scattering
diagrams to incorporate higher-twist wavefunction effects. The short-range
repulsive core in the NN interaction has previously been attributed to this
spin-spin interaction in the literature; we find that these perturbative

all I,S channels of the nucleon-nucleon system, and we compare our results for
the equivalent short-range potentials to the core potentials found by other
authors using nonperturbative methods. We also apply our perturbative
techniques to the N$\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ systems: Some $\Delta\Delta$
channels are found to have attractive core potentials and may accommodate
``molecular"" bound states near threshold. Finally we use our Born formalism to
