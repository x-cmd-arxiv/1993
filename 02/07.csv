the two dimensional Hubbard model. As well as looking at single-particle
correlations, such as $n_{{\bf k}\sigma }=\langle c^\dagger _{{\bf k}\sigma
}c_{{\bf k}\sigma } \rangle $, we also study {\it N-particle correlation
functions} which compare the relative positions of {\it all} the particles in
different models. In particular we study 16 and 18-site clusters and compare
the charge correlations in the Hubbard model with those of spinless fermions
and hard-core bosons. We find that although low densities of holes favour a
`locally-ferromagnetic' fermionic description, the correlations at larger
densities resemble those of pure hard-core bosons surprisingly well .

studied. In the case of a permutation operation or, in other word, the
shuffling operation, it is shown that the correlation can be so small that the
sequences can be regarded as independent random sequences. The applications to
the Monte Carlo simulations are also given. This method is especially useful in
the Ising Monte Carlo simulation.

two-dimensional toy model given by dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ massless
scalar fields. After making the model well-defined by imposing reflecting
boundary conditions at a critical value of the dilaton field, we quantize the
theory and derive the quantum quantum $S$-matrix for the case that $N$=$24$.
This $S$-matrix is unitary by construction, and we further argue that in the
semiclassical regime it describes the formation and subsequent Hawking
evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. Finally, we note an interesting
correspondence between the dilaton gravity $S$-matrix and that of the $c=1$
matrix model.
