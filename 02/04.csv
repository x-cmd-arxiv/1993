that are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the
material in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no
established consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for
phenomenological reasons the traditional $\alpha$ model is probably not a good
description of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum
transport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter
is more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular
momentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as
competing mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible
dynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of
the internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large
radii drive an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo.

solves the horizon and flatness problems during the epoch of classical
cosmology ($t\ge t_i\gg 10^{-43}\sec$). We show that a dynamical resolution of
the horizon problem requires superluminal expansion (or very close to it) and
that a truly satisfactory resolution of the flatness problem requires entropy
production. This implies that a proposed class of adiabatic models in which the
Planck mass varies by many orders of magnitude cannot fully resolve the
flatness problem. Furthermore, we show that, subject to minimal assumptions,
such models cannot solve the horizon problem either. Because superluminal
expansion and entropy production are the two generic features of inflationary
models, our results suggest that inflation, or something very similar, may be
the only dynamical solution to the horizon and flatness problems.

consistency of these models with the observed baryon asymmetry generically
implies strict upper bounds on the light neutrino masses. In this paper, we
analyze the situation in detail. We find that minimal models of fermion masses
face difficulties, but that it is possible for these models to generate an
adequate baryon asymmetry via non-equilibrium lepton number violating processes
when the right-handed neutrino masses are near their maximum possible values.
This condition uniquely picks out the minimal gauge symmetry breaking scheme. A
non-minimal model is also analyzed, with somewhat different conclusions due to
the nature of the imposed symmetries.

associated with our Universe, which resulted from the quantization condition.
