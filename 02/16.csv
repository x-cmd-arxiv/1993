of galaxy formation. Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy
distribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution.
Gravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that
the connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical
structure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical
structure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to
what extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of
a galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an
arbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical
underlying matter distribution. We show that a general form of such a
transformation preserves the hierarchical properties and the shape of the
dispersion in the limit of small fluctuations, i.e. on large scales, although

into lighter fermions and bosons may lead, via thermalization, to the formation
of a Bose condensate. If correct, this could generate mixed hot and cold dark
matter, with important consequences for structure formation.
  From a detailed study of such decays, we arrive at substantially different
conclusions; for a wide range of masses and decay times, we find that
stimulated emission of bosons dominates the decay. This phenomenon can best be
described as a neutrino laser, pumped by the QCD phase transition. We discuss
the implications for structure formation and the dark-matter problem.

CP-violation. Under the simplifying assumption that $(N-k)$ doublets ($k \geq

i) $(N-1) \geq 2$ and ii) the masses of the corresponding $(N-1)$ neutral

particular, the Hawking temperature of dyonic black holes depends on both the
electric and magnetic charges, and the extremal ones, which have nonzero
electric and magnetic charges, have zero temperature but nonzero entropy. These
properties are quite different from those of electrically (or magnetically)
charged dilaton black holes found by Gibbons {\it et al.} and Garfinkle {\it et

the dynamics are highly nontrivial. A collapsing shell is shown to bounce into
another universe without creating a curvature singularity on its path, and the
potential instability of the Cauchy horizon is found to be irrelevent in that
some of the infalling observers never approach the Cauchy horizon. Finally a
