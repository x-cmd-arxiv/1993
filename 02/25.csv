projected distribution of galaxy clusters obtained in Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
models with both Gaussian and skewed primordial density fluctuations. We use
N-body simulations to construct a set artificial Lick maps. An objective
cluster--finding algorithm is used to identify clusters of different richness.
For Gaussian models, the overall number of clusters is too small in the
standard CDM case, but a model with higher normalisation fares much better;
non--Gaussian models with negative skewness also fit faily well. We apply
several statistical tests to compare real and simulated cluster samples, such
as the 2-point correlation function, the minimal spanning tree construction,
the multifractal analysis and the skewness of cell counts. The emerging picture
is that Gaussian models, even with a higher normalization, are in trouble.
Skew-positive models are also ruled out, while skew-negative models can
reproduce the observed clustering of galaxy clusters in the CDM framework.

RC3, in which 65 SNe have been discovered. This relatively large number of SNe
has been redistributed in the different morphological classes of host galaxies
giving the respective SN rates. The magnitude of two biases, the overexposure
of the central part of galaxies and the inclination of the spiral parent
galaxies, have been estimated. We show that due to overexposure a increasing
fraction of SNe is lost in galaxies of increasing distances. Also, a reduced
number of SNe is discovered in inclined galaxies ($i>30\degr$): SNII and Ib are
more affected than Ia, as well as SNe in Sbc-Sd galaxies with respect to other
spirals. We strengthen previous findings that the SN rates is proportional to
the galaxy blue luminosity for all SN and Hubble types. Other sources of
errors, besides those due to the statistics of the events, have been
investigated. In particular those related to the adopted SN parameters
(Cappellaro et al. (\cite{paper1})) and correction factor for overexposure and
inclination. Moreover, we show that the frequencies of SNe per unit luminosity
vary if different sources for the parameters of the sample galaxies are
adopted, thus hampering the comparison of SN rates based on different galaxy
