limits to determine the phase diagram and the critical exponents of the one
dimensional (1D) $U-V$ model at quarter-filling. We found an instability of the
Luttinger liquid to a charge-density wave (CDW) insulator across a boundary
going from ($U$,$V$) =($+\infty$,$2t$) to ($4t$,$+\infty$). In the metallic
phase, the dominant fluctuations are superconducting if $V$ is large enough and
spin-density wave (SDW) otherwise. In the latter case, the critical exponent
$\alpha$ of the momentum distribution does not exceed 9/16. The relevance of
these results to 1D organic conductors is discussed.

affect the elastic scattering of $W_L$'s by propagating in loops, greatly

minimal low--energy supergravity models. This is based on the appearance of
non--renormalizable couplings in the superpotential. In particular, if $H_1H_2$
is an allowed operator by all the symmetries of the theory, it is natural to
promote the usual renormalizable superpotential $W_o$ to $W_o+\lambda W_o
H_1H_2$, yielding an effective $\mu$ parameter whose size is directly related
to the gravitino mass once supersymmetry is broken (this result is maintained
if $H_1H_2$ couples with different strengths to the various terms present in
$W_o$). On the other hand, the $\mu$ term must be absent from $W_o$, otherwise
the natural scale for $\mu$ would be $M_P$. Remarkably enough, this is entirely
justified in the supergravity theories coming from superstrings, where mass
terms for light fields are forbidden in the superpotential. We also analyse the
$SU(2)\times U(1)$ breaking, finding that it takes place satisfactorily.
Finally, we give a realistic example in which supersymmetry is broken by
gaugino condensation, where the mechanism proposed for solving the $\mu$
problem can be gracefully implemented.

Assuming that no light CP-even neutral scalars exist, the branching ratio for

is that of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Previously I found an infinite
symmetry algebra in the absolute BRST cohomology of the model. Here I find an
analog of the BV $\Delta$ operator, and show that it defines a natural
semirelative BRST cohomology. In the absolute cohomology, the ghost-number-zero
symmetries form the algebra of all infinitesimal spacetime diffeomorphisms,
extended at non-zero ghost numbers to the algebra of all odd-symplectic
diffeomorphisms on a spacetime supermanifold. In the semirelative cohomology,
the symmetries are reduced to $w_\infty$ at ghost number zero, and to a
topologically twisted N=2 $w_\infty$ superalgebra when all ghost numbers are
included. I discuss deformations of the model that break parts of the spacetime
symmetries while preserving the topological BRST symmetry on the worldsheet. In
the absolute cohomology of the deformed model, another topological $w_\infty$
superalgebra may emerge, while the semirelative cohomology leads to a bosonic
$w_\infty$ symmetry.
