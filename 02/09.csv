mass ($M_H\gsim60\GeV$) applies as well to the lightest Higgs boson ($h$) of
the minimal $SU(5)$ and no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity models. This
result would persist even for the ultimate LEPI lower bound ($M_H\gsim70\GeV$).
We show that this situation is a consequence of a decoupling phenomenon in the
Higgs sector driven by radiative electroweak breaking for increasingly larger
sparticle masses, and thus it should be common to a large class of supergravity
models.
  A consequence of $m_h\gsim60\GeV$ in the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model
is the exclusion from the allowed parameter space of `spoiler modes'
($\chi^0_2\to\chi^0_1 h$) which would make the otherwise very promising
trilepton signal in $p\bar p\to\chi^\pm_1\chi^0_2X$ unobservable at Fermilab.
Within this model we also obtain stronger upper bounds on the lighter
neutralino and chargino masses, \ie, $m_{\chi^0_1}\lsim50\GeV$,
$m_{\chi^0_2,\chi^\pm_1}\lsim100\GeV$. This should encourage experimental
searches with existing facilities.

First, assuming that it is generated by an unspecified source at high
temperatures, we study the effects of non-perturbative $SU(2)_W$ dynamics above
the electroweak scale, in the context of supersymmetric models. We find that
there is a substantial difference with the nonsupersymmetric case with the net
effect of relaxing previous bounds on B and L violating interactions. In
particular supersymmetry allows neutrino masses as large as 10 eV (preferred by
solar neutrino and COBE data and measurable at future neutrino oscillation
experiments). Second, we argue that the existence of a mixed lepton
number-gravitational anomaly in the standard model will induce B-L violating
interactions. These transitions would be catalized by Einstein-Yang-Mills
instantons or sphalerons and could create a primordial B-L asymmetry at Planck
temperatures or lower. Gravity (and the anomaly structure of the standard
model) could then be the ultimate source of the baryon asymmetry. We analyze
the viability of the presently known gravitational instantons and sphalerons to
realize this scenario. (Talk presented by FQ at the Texas/Pascos Conference,
