  formation"", Rome, September 2-4; LateX, 7 pages, ASTRPD-93-2-02",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a short overview on the extragalactic background radiation from
radio to X-rays, with an eye to the relation to galaxy formation and
emphasizing on astrophysical backgrounds (as opposed to cosmological). As the
radio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable
estimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we
obtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux
contributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy
radio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs,
dominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction
of the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might
face problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify
the problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of
small scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests
that their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in
comparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains
considering two AGN populations: a ""soft X-ray spectrum"" population and a ""hard
X-ray spectrum"" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB
respectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection
dominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.

over energy bins. Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be
dominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results

prediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton
component, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well. The
result is consistent with the expectation of a galactic component, consisting
of heavy nuclei only, that has a slope of about -3.1 and cuts off at 5 EeV, as

systems we consider include the standard model with two Higgs doublets, in
which case the vortex appears as part of a string-like object. The Higgs
potentials contain several different couplings in general and the spontaneous
symmetry breaking involves with two different vacuum expectation values. In
particular it is shown that the existence of such a solution in general
requires a specific ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values, i.e.
$\tan\beta$, and some inequalities between different Higgs couplings. This
ratio can be determined in terms of the couplings in the Higgs potential. The
Higgs masses are also computed in this case. (1+2)-d solutions are topological
so that they are topologically stable and the Bogomol'nyi bound is saturated
for some couplings. Some comments on the stabilization of (1+3)-d solutions are
also given. Thus, as long as such a defect can be formed in the early universe,
stable or not, $\tan\beta$ is no longer an independent free parameter in the
theory.

baryon asymmetry in a primordial asymmetry for the right-handed electron, which
due to its weak Yukawa interaction only comes into chemical equilibrium as the
sphalerons are falling out of equilibrium. This would also raise the
possibility of preserving an initial baryon asymmetry when $B-L = 0$.
