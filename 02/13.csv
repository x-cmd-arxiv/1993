to predict which systems are likely to form local icosahedral structures when

minimal energy structures, and characterize all detected minima from both their
relative probability and from a structural point of view. We identify regions
in our parameter space where the icosahedral structure is dominant (like in the
corresponding monoatomic case), regions where the icosahedral structure
disappears and other where icosahedral structures are present but not dominant.
Finally, we compare our results with simulations reported in literature and

string propagation: shock waves, singular plane waves, conical spacetimes and
de Sitter cosmological spacetime. The calculation of various physical
quantities like the string mass and the energy-momentum tensor shows that
classical and quantum string propagation in shock-waves and singular plane
waves is physically meaningful and full of interesting new phenomena.The
important phenomenom of {\bf string stretching} that takes place when strings
fall into spacetime singularities and in expanding universes is analyzed.We
conclude by reporting on strings in de Sitter spacetime, where the string
