the main focus on the question whether or not a charged anyon fluid exhibits a
superconductivity at zero and finite temperature. Quantum mechanics of anyon
fluids is precisely described by Chern-Simons gauge theory. The random phase
approximation (RPA), the linearized self-consistent field method (SCF), and the
hydrodynamic approach employed in the early analysis of anyon fluids are all
equivalent. Relations and differences between neutral and charged anyon fluids
are discussed. It is necessary to go beyond RPA and the linearized SCF, and
possively beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation, to correctly describe various
phenomena such as the flux quantization, vortex formation, and phase
transition.

experimentally accessible areal densities of $^{3}$He. This interaction is
attractive and gives rise to the p-wave transition temperature which for
moderate areal densities is estimated to be on the scale of several
millikelvin. The relevance of these results to the anomaly in the specific heat
observed at $ T_k = 3.2 \, \mbox{mK} $ is discussed.

particle moving on a quantum plane $Q_{q,p}$. For Lagrangian mechanics, we
first define a tangent quantum plane $TQ_{q,p}$ spanned by noncommuting
particle coordinates and velocities. Using techniques similar to those of Wess
and Zumino, we construct two different differential calculi on $TQ_{q,p}$.
These two differential calculi can in principle give rise to two different
particle dynamics, starting from a single Lagrangian. For Hamiltonian
mechanics, we define a phase space $T^*Q_{q,p}$ spanned by noncommuting
particle coordinates and momenta. The commutation relations for the momenta can
be determined only after knowing their functional dependence on coordinates and
velocities.
  Thus these commutation relations, as well as the differential calculus on
$T^*Q_{q,p}$, depend on the initial choice of Lagrangian. We obtain the
deformed Hamilton's equations of motion and the deformed Poisson brackets, and
their definitions also depend on our initial choice of Lagrangian. We
illustrate these ideas for two sample Lagrangians. The first system we examine
corresponds to that of a nonrelativistic particle in a scalar potential. The
other Lagrangian we consider is first order in time derivatives

be viewed as (BRST) cohomologies of affine Lie algebras. The set $\cal W$
contains many known $W$ algebras such as $W_N$ and $W_3^{(2)}$. Our formalism
yields a completely algorithmic method for calculating the W algebra generators
and their operator product expansions, replacing the cumbersome construction of
W algebras as commutants of screening operators. By generalizing and quantizing
the Miura transformation we show that any $W$ algebra in $\cal W$ can be
embedded into the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple affine Lie
algebra which is, up to shifts in level, isomorphic to a subalgebra of the
original affine algebra. Therefore {\em any} realization of this semisimple
affine Lie algebra leads to a realization of the $W$ algebra. In particular,
one obtains in this way a general and explicit method for constructing the free
field realizations and Fock resolutions for all algebras in $\cal W$. Some
examples are explicitly worked out.
