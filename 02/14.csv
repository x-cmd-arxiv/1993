  upon request (if urgent by fax; if by snail mail give address); University of
  Michigan preprint UM-TH-93-06 (February 1993)",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph",,"  I address the question of whether supersymmetry provides a viable candidate
for the dark matter in the Universe. I review the properties of the lightest
neutralino as a candidate for solving the dark matter problem. I discuss the
neutralino's phenomenological and cosmological properties, and constraints from
present and future experiments. In the minimal supersymmetric model, the
neutralino mass has been experimentally excluded below some $20$ GeV, and is
not expected to be significantly larger than about $150$ GeV. I identify a
gaugino-like neutralino as the most natural dark matter candidate for a
plausible range of parameters. The requirement that the lightest neutralino be
the dominant matter component in the flat Universe provides non-trivial
restrictions on other parameters of the model, in particular on the masses of
the sfermions. Next, I study the consequences of adopting further grand
unification assumptions. In both scenarios I find sfermion masses most likely
beyond the reach of LEP 200 and the Tevatron but well within the discovery
potential of the SSC and the LHC. I also comment on the effects of relaxing
grand unification assumptions. Finally, I briefly outline prospects for the
neutralino dark matter searches.

a matrix-model-inspired approach to $2{-}d$ quantum supergravity. Here we prove
that this hierarchy is essentially the KdV hierarchy, where the KdV field is
now replaced by an even superfield. This allows us to find the conserved
charges and the bihamiltonian structure, and to prove its integrability. We
also extend the hierarchy by odd flows in a supersymmetric fashion.

gravitational backgrounds. The proposed solutions are constructed using $N = 4$
superconformal building blocks with $\hat c = 4$. We give two different and
inequivalent realizations of non-trivial four-dimensional subspaces, and we
show the emergence of the $N = 4$ globally defined superconformal symmetry. The
existence of $N = 4$ world-sheet symmetry stabilizes our solutions and implies
in target space a number of covariantized supersymmetries around space-time
dependent gravitational and dilaton backgrounds.
