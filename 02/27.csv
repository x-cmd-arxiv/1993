connection is considered. This model is a topological one, in the sense that
the classical action does not contain a metric or zweibein at all. A metric and
an additional vector field are instead introduced in the process of solving
equations of motion for the connection. They satisfy the constant curvature
equation. It is shown that the general solution of these equations of motion
can be described by using the space of orbits under the action of the Weyl
group in the functional space containing all pairs formed by a metric and a
vectorfield. It is shown also that this model admits an equivalent description
by using a family of actions depending on the metric and the connection as
independent variables.

matter is a quasi-Dirac neutrino whose mass $m_{DM}$ arises at the one-loop
level. The solar neutrino deficit is explained via nonadiabatic conversions of
electron neutrino to a sterile neutrino and the atmospheric neutrino data via
maximal muon neutrino to tau neutrino oscillations generated by higher order
loop diagrams. For $m_{DM} \sim 30$ eV the radiative neutrino decay can lead to
photons that can ionize interstellar hydrogen. In one of the models one can
have observable $\nu_e$ to $\nu_\tau$ oscillation rates, with no appreciable
muon neutrino oscillations at accelerator experiments. In addition, there can
be observable rates for tau number violating processes such as $\tau \to 3e$
and $\tau \to e + \gamma$. In the other model one can have sizeable $\nu_e$ to
$\nu_\mu$ oscillation rates, as well as sizeable rates for muon number
violating processes such as $\mu \to e + \gamma$, $\mu \to e + majoron$ and
$\mu \to 3e$.

backscattering a low energy laser off of one of the original electron beams.

$\kappa_\gamma$ to $\pm 0.15$ at 95\% C.L. which is comparable to the $W$ pair
production process. Finally, we examined $W$ production at 500 GeV and 1 TeV
