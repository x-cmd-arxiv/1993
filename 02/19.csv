in cosmology and in the dynamics of the Universe itself. We begin with an
analysis of the nature and origin of irreversibility in well-known physical
processes such as dispersion, diffusion, dissipation and mixing, and make the
distinction between processes whose irreversibility arises from the stipulation
of special initial conditions, and those arising from the system's interaction
with a coarse-grained environment. We then study the irreversibility associated
with quantum fluctuations in cosmological processes like particle creation and
the `birth of the Universe'. We suggest that the backreaction effect of such
quantum processes can be understood as the manifestation of a
fluctuation-dissipation relation relating fluctuations of quantum fields to
dissipations in the dynamics of spacetime. For the same reason it is shown that
dissipation is bound to appear in the dynamics of minisuperspace cosmologies.
This provides a natural course for the emergence of a cosmological and
thermodynamic arrow of time and suggests a meaningful definition of
gravitational entropy. We conclude with a discussion on the criteria for the
choice of coarse-grainings and the stability of persistent physical structures.

address the question of whether such nonlinear Higgs-top interaction effects

necessarily accompanied by Higgs ""bags"", then top quark weak decay would
involve the sudden disruption of the Higgs ""bag"", with copious production of
physical Higgs particles accompanying the decay. We then examine the effects
that such Higgs ""bags"" would produce on the spectrum of toponium, where the two
bound top (anti)quarks, and their ""bags"", overlap. We numerically evaluate the
effects that the nonlinear feedback in the Higgs-toponium system would have on
the energy level splittings of the toponium bound states, and find that for
allowed values of the top and Higgs mass the effect is negligible, thus
indicating that even in this favourable circumstance Higgs ""bag"" formation
around top quarks does not observably occur. Finally, we consider the case of a
second Higgs doublet, allowing the possibility of enhanced couplings for one of
the physical Higgs to top. Even in this nonstandard scenario the effects are
minimal, and we infer the general absence of observable effects at any level
that might suggest the utility of considering top quarks to be accompanied by
Higgs ""bags"".

derivation of the quantum effective action in the gauged WZW theory is
presented in detail, both in the bosonic and in the supersymmetric cases. We
explain why and how one can truncate the effective action by omitting most of
the non-local terms (thus providing a justification for some previous
suggestions). The resulting metric, dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor are
non-trivial functions of $1/k$ (or $\alpha'$) and represent a large class of
conformal sigma models. The exact expressions for the fields in the
sypersymmetric case are equal to the leading order (`semiclassical') bosonic
expressions (with no shift of $k$). An explicit form in which we find the sigma
model couplings makes it possible to prove that the metric and the dilaton are
equivalent to the fields which are obtained in the operator approach, i.e. by
identifying the $L_0$-operator of the conformal theory with a Klein-Gordon
operator in a background. The metric can be considered as a `deformation' of an
invariant metric on the coset space $G/H$ and the dilaton can be in general
represented in terms of the logarithm of the ratio of the determinants of the
`deformed' and `round' metrics.

proposed equivalence to the non-compact $N=4$ fermionic string model. The
issues of space-time Lorentz covariance and supersymmetry for the BRST
quantized $N=2$ strings living in uncompactified $2 + 2$ dimensions are
discussed. The equivalent local quantum supersymmetric field theory appears to
be the most transparent way to represent the space-time symmetries of the
extended fermionic strings and their interactions. Our considerations support
the Siegel's ideas about the presence of $SO(2,2)$ Lorentz symmetry as well as
at least one self-dual space-time supersymmetry in the theory of the $N=2(4)$
fermionic strings, though we do not have a compelling reason to argue about the
necessity of the {\it maximal} space-time supersymmetry. The world-sheet
arguments about the absence of all string massive modes in the physical
spectrum, and the vanishing of all string-loop amplitudes in the Polyakov
approach, are given on the basis of general consistency of the theory.

positive and negative energy phase shifts at zero momentum related to the total
number of bound states. In this letter we prove a stronger version of
Levinson's theorem valid for positive and negative energy phase shifts
separately. The surprising result is, that in general the phase shifts for each
sign of the energy do not give the number of bound states with the same sign of
the energy (in units of $\pi$), but instead, are related to the number of bound
states of a certain Schr\""odinger equation, which coincides with the Dirac
equation at zero momentum.

The following result was proved by the second author.
  Theorem 0.1. There is a numerical constant $K_1$ such that for all finite
sequences $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ in $A$ we have
$$\leqalignno{&\max\left\{\left\|\left(\sum u(x_i)^*
u(x_i)\right)^{1/2}\right\|_B, \left\|\left(\sum u(x_i)

  A simpler proof was given in [H1]. More recently an other alternate proof
appeared in [LPP]. In this paper we give a sequence of generalizations of this
inequality.

  We give an affirmative answer with the only restriction that $M$ is assumed
semi-finite.

phase shift representations for the two Reid potentials and the more recent
Moscow potential. The values of these parameters were obtained from integrals
of the zero-energy wave function in a similar manner to that for the effective
range. Such expressions for the shape parameters yield more reliable numerical
values of the shape parameter than those obtained by least-mean-square or
polynomial fits. We show that the eigenphase representation is more meaningful
than the `bar' phase shift representation and that the variation in the values
of $P_\alpha$ in the models may be of significance.
