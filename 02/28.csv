  European Electron Facility Project",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  High-energy spin physics became a popular topic recently after the EMC
finding for the proton's spin content. There exist unmeasured spin-dependent
structure functions ($b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$) for spin-one hadrons such
as the deuteron. The tensor structure function $b_1(x)$ could be measured by
the proposed 15 GeV European Electron Facility. The measurement provides
important clues to physics of non-nucleonic components in spin-one nuclei and
to tensor structures on the quark-parton level.

generalization of finite dimensional Lie algebra cohomology. The differential d
and other operators are realized as universal inner deri- vations of a
completed algebra, which acts on any appropriate semi-infinite complex. In
particular, d is shown to be the unique derivation satisfying the ""Cartan
identity"" and certain natural degree conditions. The proof that d is
square-zero may well be the shortest (arguably, the only) one in print.

- Sicily, 5-12 December 1992. We review the superconformal properties of 2d
matter coupled to gravity, and extensions thereof. Focusing on topological
strings, we recall how the superconformal structure helps to provide a direct
link between Liouville theory coupled to matter, and matrix models. We also
construct an infinite class of new theories based on $W$-gravity.
