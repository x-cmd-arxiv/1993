dynamical systems, from which any long time average can be computed. It has
never been extracted from an experimental time series the reason being its
sensitivity to noise. It is shown, by numerical simulations, that the
sensitivity of the scaling function is to drift in the control parameters, and
not noise. It is also explained how naive averaging of the orbit points may
lead to erroneous results.

work of Roux, a random walker algorithm is constructed to solve the problem of
crack growth in an elastic medium. In contrast to conventional lattice
approaches, the stress field is not calculated throughout the whole medium, but
random walkers are used to detect only the hot sites on the surface of the
crack. Using this new method we generate crack-clusters up to sizes of 20,000

argued that this problem leaves the Hilbert space formulation of quantum field

reinforcing the view that a sum-over-histories framework is the most promising

in the nucleon ground state is presented. The method focuses on a comparison of
quark distributions in the nucleon with those in the $\Delta$ baryon resonance.
Recent lattice QCD calculations of these quark distribution radii are analyzed
in a search for evidence of scalar diquark clustering. The analysis indicates
the lattice results describe the negative squared charge radius of the neutron
with little resort to hyperfine clustering between $u$-$d$-quark pairs. This
result contrasts both quark-diquark and nonrelativistic quark models where
hyperfine attraction between $u$ and $d$ quarks in the nucleon is argued to
play a significant role. Comparison of light quark distributions in $\Lambda^0$
and $\Sigma^{*0}$ indicate only a small reduction of the scalar diquark
distribution radius relative to the vector diquark distribution. Current
lattice QCD determinations of baryon charge distributions do not support the
concept of substantial $u$-$d$ scalar diquark clustering as an appropriate
description of the internal structure of the nucleon.

is used to set limits on Higgs masses for some recent models with specific
ansatz about the flavor changing couplings. For example, in the Cheng--Sher
scenario of multi-Higgs doublet models, all neutral Higgs bosons possess flavor
changing ($f_i \leftrightarrow f_j)$ couplings proportional to $\sqrt{m_i

some of these spacetimes.
