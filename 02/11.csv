theory, Einstein's general relativity will be a very low curvature effective
theory. At larger curvatures, new terms will become important. The question
then arises as to whether it is possible to construct an effective action for
gravity which leads to a nonsingular theory. In this work, we construct an
effective action for gravity in which all homogenerous and isotropic solutions
are nonsingular. In particular, there is neither a big bang nor a big crunch.
Preliminary work indicates that our construction provides a theory in which
anisotropies decrease at large curvatures, and in which the inside of a black
hole is singularity free.

the effective field theory of the standard model below the chiral symmetry
breaking scale. The effective chiral Lagrangian formulated in terms of the
pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons ($\pi, \, K, \, \eta$) is briefly discussed. It
is shown how one can gain insight into the ratios of the light quark masses and
to what extent these statements are model--independent. A few selected topics
concerning the dynamics and interactions of the Goldstone bosons are
considered. These are $\pi \pi$ and $\pi K$ scattering, some non--leptonic kaon
decays and the problem of strong pionic final state interactions. CHPT also
allows to make precise statements about the temperature dependence of QCD Green
functions and the finite size effects related to the propagation of the
(almost) massless pseudoscalar mesons. A central topic is the inclusion of
matter fields, baryon CHPT. The relativistic and the heavy fermion formulation
of coupling the baryons to the Goldstone fields are discussed. As applications,
photo--nucleon processes, the $\pi N$ $\Sigma$--term and non--leptonic hyperon
decays are presented. Implications of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry
on the nuclear forces and meson exchange currents are also described. Finally,
the use of effective field theory methods in the strongly coupled Higgs sector
and in the calculation of oblique electroweak corrections is touched upon.

through the running of $ \alpha_ s. $ Physical features of jet fluctuations
such as collimation at large angles and saturation at small angles are well
described in the perturbative framework. A parameter-free prediction of angular
intermittency is proposed for $ {\cal Z}^0 $ decays into hadrons, assuming
hadron-parton duality.
